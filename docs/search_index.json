The crux of the idea here is that mangrove geomorphology in an applied sense exists largely through nominal definitions, when in actuality there is high heterogeneity within many of the various classes. I will review the literature surrounding mangrove geomorphology from a historical perspective, identify key factors to be quantified or monitored, and look at potential remote sensing applications that exist today, or will be coming online in the next 5 to 10 years. Target journal: Remote Sensing of Environment Coauthors: Iryna Dronova (UCB LAEP); Marc Simard (NASA JPL)?? MDP Research questions: What are the existing applications of remote sensing data to hydrology and sedimentary processes in mangrove ecosystems to date? Given new RS data types and their applications in fields outside of mangrove ecology, what opportunities for mapping and better-understanding mangrove geomorphology exist? Given new RS data types and their applications…, what challenges for mapping and better-understanding mangrove geomorphology exist? Abstract: For mangrove restoration and conservation projects, it is critical to understand the relationships between mangrove tree species and the geomorphological conditions in which they exist, as well as how they vary over time. While remote sensing of mangrove vegetation is commonplace within the academic literature, fewer studies employ remote sensing to study mangrove geomorphology. The use of remote sensing offers a valuable means to understand mangrove geomorphology at various temporal and spatial scales, as field studies of mangrove hydrology and sedimentary processes are complex and difficult. Given the rapid development of remote sensing technology, a thorough examination of the existing techniques and best practices for better understanding mangrove geomorphology is warranted. Thus, we present here a review of remote sensing of geomorphological processes in mangroves. Our review shows that use of remote sensing to monitor mangrove geomorphology has largely been limited to studies of shoreline erosion and progradation over the past few decades. Increasingly available new data sources such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral datasets, however, are providing access to novel and informative data layers, such as topography at fine resolutions and total suspended sediment. Leveraging future advances in remote sensing to better monitor mangrove geomorphology will be important for conserving these ecosystems, particularly given increasing global pressures from coastal development and sea level rise.

I currently envisage this as testing for correlations between soil organic carbon stocks and forest biomass, structure, and species composition properties. I am working on building a database for mangroves of the Americas with a URAP student that parallels the one I built for Southeast Asia during my master’s work, and am interested in testing the same models on the new dataset. I am also considering getting another URAP student to begin compiling a database for Africa / the middle East, which is the other major region for mangroves. One valuable product would be a comprehensive database of mangrove forest structure and soil characteristics data, with checks on how comparable the different sampling methodologies, datasets, etc. are.

Note: If I am successful in constructing a database of forest structure, species, etc. from the literature, there are many other research questions that can be explored, such as: Examining effects of sea level rise or tidal range on mangrove structure &amp; species assemblages.

["zonation.html", "3.1 Zonation &amp; disturbance", " 3.1 Zonation &amp; disturbance 3.1.1 Preface Establishment of monospecific stands of mangrove trees in zones parallel to shorelines (zonation) has been among the most well-studied phenomenon in mangroves. Several hypotheses attempting to explain zonation in mangroves have existed throughout time, each of which has been supported to varying degrees within the literature: Zonation as mangrove succession due to land building - Davis, 1940: From his work in Florida, Davis believed that mangroves promoted shoreline progradation, which was followed by establishment of Avicennia germinans species in the most seaward portion of the intertidal zone. Eventually Rhizophora mangle with a few Laguncularia racemosa individuals would outcompete A. germinans as the shore (and thus habitat for A. germinans) continued to prograde. Davis believed that the zones of species were a successional process, eventually climaxing in a terrestrial forest dominated by non-mangrove species. [Not supported] Zonation as response to geomorphic condition - Thom, 1967: Thom did his field work in a composite lagoon and riverine system in Tabasco, Mexico, and provided one of the first most comprehensive sets of evidence against Davis’s hypothesis of zonation as mangrove succession. In looking at the different habitats in which mangrove tree species existed, Thom concluded that zonation of species was in response to the hydrological and substratum conditions of a site, which were ultimately variables controlled by geomorphic processes. As a result, he concluded that spatial patterns of mangrove species were in response to geomorphic changes in the land rather than mangrove species inducing patterns in geomorphology (and thus species zonation was relatively “stable”). [Supported] Zonation as adaptation to physico-chemical gradients - Watson, 1928; Davis, 1940; Macnae, 1968; Ball 1988: One of the more commonly examined hypotheses for examining species zonation and investigated by a wide range of researchers. Watson’s “inundation classes” and discussion of salinity may be one of the earliest, well-cited references to environmental gradients. The hypothesis holds that mangrove species have adapted to establish or compete in microenvironments that exist along environmental gradients. Given the dynamic nature of mangrove ecosystems, it is unlikely that mangrove species specialize to unique microenvironments, but more likely exhibit tolerance to a wide range of conditions. However, some may preferentially outcompete others in environments towards the ends of gradient spectrums, and thus ecophysiology may play an important role in competition and survival or growth following establishment. [Supported, for particular considerations] Zonation as result of interspecific competition - Clarke and Hannon, 1970: Zonation due to tidal sorting of propagules - Rabinowitz, 1978: Upon investigating no significant difference in survival and growth rates of Avicennia, Rhizophora, Laguncularia, and Pelliciera tree individuals planted in monospecific stands in Panama, Rabinowitz concluded that mangrove zonation is not primarily controlled by physiological variables. In response, she hypothesized that the zonation of species may be due to differences in propagule size and weight between species. The hypothesis posits that differences in size and weight have enabled species to establish in areas with different tidal regimes (smaller propagules in shoreward zones, larger propagules in landward zones). Rabinowitz provides a discussion of the hypothesis and identifies several other studies that may support the hypothesis. [Partially supported - directionality NOT supported whereas tidal depth supported] Zonation as result of differential predation on propagules - Smith, 1987: (Smith 1987) was among the first studies to experimentally test the existence of differential rates of propagule predation by grapsid crabs for different mangrove tree species. His results showed that differential rates of mangrove predation did exist for the distinct species, and were correlated to the nutritional content (e.g., presence of tannins, simple sugars, etc.) of the species. Furthermore, he found a significant negative relationship between species dominance and rate of propagule predation, which led him to conclude that differential rates of propagule predation influence the zonation of species in mangroves. Perhaps most clearly, he found that A. marina was consumed heavily within the mid-intertidal region of the forest, in which no parent trees of A. marina exist. Smith notes that no single hypothesis is likely to explain all of zonation, but that the results of his study are significant and parallel those of other studies in terrestrial forests. [Partially supported] Several comprehensive reviews of zonation in mangroves are provided in: Lugo and Snedaker, 1974 (Reviewed in Section 3.1.3) Smith, 1992 (Reviewed in Section 3.1.9) 3.1.2 Thom, 1967 “Mangrove ecology and deltaic geomorphology: Tabasco, Mexico” (Thom 1967) Key contribution: Thom’s work in the lagoons and riverine settings (“composite river &amp; wave-dominated”) of Tabasco, Mexico was one of the most well-cited examples against Thom’s hypothesis of mangrove succession. In looking at the different hydrological regimes and substratum of various mangrove “zones,” he concluded that mangrove zonation in species was in response to geomorphic condition and was relatively stable in time (as opposed to altering landscapes and facilitating succession). Thom generally concluded that mangroves were opportunistic in their establishment, but particular species do have the capabilities to affect the rates at which geomorphic processes occur such as prop roots of Rhizophora spps. choking tidal channels. The following chart details the presence of different stand types within the geomorphic settings of Tabasco, Mexico. Key findings: Thom’s findings provided evidence that: Mangroves establish in areas of naturally accreting soil, but facilitate accretion of soil upon establishment (e.g., Rhizophora choking creeks &amp; channels). Mangroves are opportunistic in their establishment, largely responding to geomorphic conditions Thom went on to provide a series of geomorphic clastic and carbonate settings in which mangroves “generally” exist Further reading: Thom 1982 - Identification of five geomorphic clastic settings Thom 1984 - Identification of three geomorphic carbonate settings 3.1.3 Lugo &amp; Snedaker, 1974 “The ecology of mangroves” (Lugo and Snedaker 1974) Key contribution: Lugo and Snedaker’s seminal work on the ecology of mangroves (in Florida) is most commonly cited for their definition of six mangrove forest types: Fringe forest - Mangrove assemblages that are found on the fringes of sheltered coastlines. Zonation in species typically follows Davis’s patterns. Riverine forest - Tall forests found in floodplains and along riverine systems of deltas and estuaries. These may occur in conjunction with “fringe forests,” are tidally flushed, yet have more complex hydrological influences from upland, freshwater sources. Overwash forest - Forest types often consisting of Rhizophora species over low islands or small projections in bays and estuaries that are only inundated with high tides. Basin forest - Mangrove assemblages that occur in the “basins” in between tidal channels and distributaries, or behind the levees of rivers and channels. Often among the most extensive sections of mangrove forests and may exhibit zonation with changes in elevation as the landward zone of the forest is reached. Hammock forest - A variant of the basin forest occuring in fringe forests in areas of raised topography. Dwarf forest - Mangrove forests that occur along flat coastal fringes and are stunted in growth (height) due to nutrient limitations. In addition, Lugo and Snedaker provide a review of matter cycling in mangroves; however, more recent reviews of the topic have been written and should be referred to. Lugo and Snedaker provide a conceptual model of energy flows in mangroves that should be reviewed: 3.1.4 Rabinowitz, 1978a “Dispersal properties of mangrove propagules” (Rabinowitz 1978a) Key contribution: This paper provides a review of propagule physiology and establishment for six species from Panama (L. racemosa, A. germinans, A. bicolor, R. mangle, R. harisonii, and P. rhizophorae). Rabinowitz reviews the different anatomy and physiology of the four genera, and then provides results from experiments on dispersal characteristics such as time of floatation, time to rotting and time to establishment. Key knowledge: Mangroves are viviparous in that propagules go from parent tree to embryonic stage to establishment continuously without a “dormant” period. Propagules often sprout roots during the dispersal stage, which aids in their establishment. Key finding: After her experiments, Rabinowitz found that smaller propagules from Avicennia and Laguncularia were less capable of sinking or establishing underwater, and thus are more likely to be limited to higher areas with periodic absences of tidal inundation (where they are characteristically found). The larger propagules of Rhizophora and Pelliciera are capable of sinking and establishing underwater, and thus are not limited in areas of establishment. 3.1.5 Rabinowitz, 1978b “Early growth of mangrove seedlings in Panama, and an hypothesis concerning the relationship of dispersal and zonation” (Rabinowitz 1978b) Study design: Examined growth and survival of R. harisonii. A. sps, L. racemosa, and P. rhizophorae in each of four monospecific parent swamps in different locations of Panama (i.e., four parent stands at each of four sites). Gardens of each of the four species were planted and examined for growth and survival to see if seedlings fared better in stands of their parent species. Key findings: Rabinowitz examined establishment of four different genera (Avicennia, Laguncularia, Pelliciera, and Rhizphora) in stands of both their parent genus as well as others. Her findings were primarily: seedlings generally grew better in habitats of other mangroves than in own parents habitat growth of seedling largely equal across parents swamps superior growth (when present) typically seen in foreign swamp no habitat with greater growth across all mangroves Thus, Rabinowitz found little evidence of the hypothesis that physiological conditions along a tidal gradient control mangrove zonation. The graph below shows survival of seedings of the four genera in the four different parent habitats. Key contribution: In response to her findings, Rabinowitz provides the “tidal sorting” hypothesis, which posits that “mangrove zonation may be controlled by tidal sorting of propagules according to size and by differential ability of propagules to establish in deep water.” She provides a discussion of the hypothesis as well as links it to several studies in the academic literature which support the notion. Key limitations: The key limitations of the study is the length of the work (just one year), as well as consideration of only seedlings rather than saplings and seedlings. Ecophysiological controls on survival rates may not occur until later in time (in which competitive influences are stronger), and thus the conclusion that Rabinowitz gives may have been premature (see (McKee 1995)). Further reading: Rabinowitz, 1978 - “Dispersal properties of mangrove propagules” Sousa et al, 2007 3.1.6 Putz &amp; Chan, 1986 “Tree growth dynamics and productivity in a mature mangrove forest in Malaysia” (Putz and Chan 1986) Key contribution: This study describes mangrove development and growth dynamics in a protected forest in Matang, Malaysia over the course of 60 years. The research represents one of the few studies done on mangroves over many decades, as disturbance regimes often prevent long-term succession as well as a lack of research interest. Key findings: Several key findings in long-term mangrove development were identified: R. apiculata slowly decreased in forest dominance relative to B. gymnorrhiza and B. parviflora. Bruguiera species are more shade-tolerant and may represent a more traditionally “climax” class of mangrove species. Gap openings were largely caused by termites and fungus killing trees, which would fall against neighboring trees, damage roots and bark and allow termites to transfer trees. Putz and Chan describe the disturbance dynamics as “domino-like,” but also note it is unlikley to be “normal” disturbance dynamics. Based on growth-rates and age-class distributions, Putz and Chan conclude that self-thinning did occur within the forest, particularly for R. apiculata. Total biomass was relatively high, with “stable” biomass estimated at 350-400 Mg/Ha. 3.1.7 Smith, 1987 “Seed predation in relation to tree dominance and distribution in mangrove forests” (Smith 1987) Key contribution: This is one of the earliest examinations of the effects of predation (by grapsid crabs) on propagule survival for different species. They found significant relationships between propagule predation and nutritional content, as well as location within the intertidal floor. The results led them to conclude that propagule predation is a significant factor in defining zonation in mangrove forests. Experimental design: Propagules were tethered to twine strings and monitored over 18 days in 5 replicate plots in each of three forest types (high, intermediate and low conspecific dominance) for each of the five species. Additionally, propagules of each of the five species were analyzed for nutritional content and related to predation patterns using PCA. Key results: The findings show that differential predation for certain species does occur. In particular, predation on A. marina in the mid intertidal was found to explain the relative absence of parent A. marina trees in the mid-intertidal section of the forest. Rates of predation of A. marina were found to be higher than in the low or high intertidal regions. With the exception of Ceriops tagal, amount of predation was significantly negatively correlated with conspecific dominance (i.e., low dominance by parent trees led to high predation rates) across the other four species. 3.1.8 Smith, 1989 “Comparisons of seed predation in tropica, tidal forests from three continents” (Smith et al. 1989) 3.1.9 Smith, 1992 “Forest structure” (In Robertson and Alongi, 2002) (Smith 1992) Overview: This chapter (from Robertson and Alongi, 2002) gives a broad overview of mangrove forest structure with a particular emphasis on zonation in species. Smith describes factors that influence species composition, the patterns of species assemblages across the intertidal zone, and physical forest structure attributes such as height or stem density. Key knowledge: Mangroves lack understory vegetation commonly found within terrestrial tropical forests Species zonation patterns differ between “Old World” and “New World” tropics (???) primary zonation hypotheses: land building &amp; succession geomorphology response to physico-chemical gradients tidal sorting hypothesis differential predation interspecific competition Many mangroves have even-aged size-class structure Stand height, density and biomass accumulation seem to correlate with climatic factors, particularly rainfall Mangroves appear to have more pioneer-phase traits (e.g., r-strategy dispersal of propagules) relative to mature-phase traits - which may support Thom, 1967’s hypothesis of “opportunistic” establishment. Status of zonation hypotheses as of 1992: Further reading: Chapman 1976 - Extensive review of early literature surrounding mangrove zonation 3.1.10 Chen &amp; Twilley, 1998 “A gap dynamic model of mangrove forest development along gradients of soil salinity and nutrient resources” (Chen and Twilley 1998) Key contribution: This study employs a FORMAN model to examine forest development and succession in South Florida across nutrient gradients. The study is novel in that it employs an individual-tree based model to examine different effects of recruitment, nutrient availability, and response to disasters (hurricanes) for R. mangle, A. germinans and L. racemosa. Key findings: The study primarily examines i) species dominance (as measured by BA) in response to salinity and nutrient response surfaces, ii) regeneration following disturbance, and iii) long-term mangrove succession (500 yrs). Key findings from each of the three model explorations are detailed below: nutrient gradients - BA didn’t increase linearly with increasing soil fertility, indicating that light or competition influence forest development; patterns of forest development varied depending on time scales (35 vs. 100 vs. 300 years). At 100-year time frame, patterns in species partitioning along resource gradients was observed. disturbance - equal sapling recruitment scenarios for all three species overestimated total basal area, which is indicative that recruitment rates are not equal amongst species; succession - long-term succession was found to be sensitive to recruitment rates for each species. The degree of shade tolerance/intolerance of the different species was concluded to be significant in long-term succession dynamics. Research relevance: Can the same models be employed to look at shifts in forest structure due to sea-level rise? 3.1.11 Sherman et al, 2000 “Small-scale disturbance and regeneration dynamics in a neotropical mangrove forest” (Sherman, Fahey, and Battles 2000) Key contribution: Sherman et al describe chracteristics of gap creation and closure through time and gap regeneration dynamics in the Dominican Republic. The primary intermediate disturbance at their site is lightning-induced gaps, with the forest regenerating from a large tidal wave several decades prior. Their evidence does not support the hypothesis that zonation in mangrove species is reinforced by gap regeneration, with R. mangle dominating gap regeneration in all three zone types. Key findings: The following key findings are provided by the study: Hypothesis that species zonation is reinforced by gap dynamics was not supported by evidence R. mangle dominated gap regeneration, not due to increased density of seedlings (found to be highly variable with patterns emerging depending on dominant species zone), but due to higher survivorship in standing water; seedling &amp; sapling growth found to be significantly greater in gaps than forest Gaps were characterized by a collapse of the peat-mat and thus regions of standing water Found that seedling and sapling density generally followed mature tree (by basal area) compositions for both transects Current spatial distribution of species zones is still unexplained for the site NOTE Need to go back and figure out how long this study was performed for! 3.1.12 Sousa et al, 2007 “Supply-side ecology in mangroves: Do propagule dispersal and seedling establishment explain forest structure?” (Sousa et al. 2007) Supply-side ecology: “hypothesis of community structure being influenced more heavily by supply of new individuals to a site rather than post-recruitment biotic interactions (Roughgarden by Lewin [1986])” Tidal sorting hypothesis: TSH has multiple components: Dispersal of mangrove propagules is controlled primarily by their shape and size Establishment of mangrove propagules is differentiated by size and depth of tidal waters Key contribution: Sousa et al provides one of the few empirical tests of the TSH. Their results by and large do not strictly support all components of the TSH: Direction (NOT SUPPORTED) - all propagules dispersed seawards, regardless of size Distance (SUPPORTED) - Laguncularia propagules travelled much further than Rhizophora or Avicennia trapping of seedlings behind logs or other barriers contributes to patchy establishment Establishment (SUPPORTED) - only Rhizophora established in the pen at the lowest tidal elevation, which is indicative that larger heavier propagules are better able to establish in deeper water (as TSH predicts) Key findings: Directional flow of rainfall runoff overwhelms tidal flows and causes all propagules to disperse in a seawards direction Rhizophora seedlings moved very short distances, indicating that their commonly-believed widespread dispersal via marine systems may be misrepresentative of average dispersal mechanisms, particularly within mature forests. The TSH does not sufficiently explain zonation at the Punta de Galeta. Sousa et al provide two alternative hypotheses for zonation TSH may function strictly during periods of tidal storm surge, when smaller propagules are carried much further inland Zonation may be a result of historical patterns of biogeography as the three species appeared in the region at different times In addition, the authors provide three key criticisms of Rabinowitz’s TSH: Her early studies of species survival and growth in stands of different parent organisms only lasted for a year, and thus physico-chemical factors may not have had time to influence survival given large nutrient reserves. Other studies, however, have since supported Rabinowitz’s findings and provide evidence against the physico-chemical hypothesis of zonation The patterns of zonation predicted by the TSH do not always occur in mangroves; their are examples of forests where the species patterning is different or even opposite from what is predicted. The pattern of disperal predicted by TSH does not hold in all cases; Sousa et al found that dispersal direction was actually opposite of what was predicted by TSH.

There are more recent reviews that should be referred to, but this chapter provides a nice overview of some of the earlier work related to mangrove vegetation and ecological factors. Key notes: Inundation - The effects of salinity versus frequency and duration of inundation likely influences seedlings versus mature trees differentially. Inundation “classes” were originally proposed by Watson (and others), but likely have little practical value now. Number of days of lack of inundation is understood (by Chapman) to be the most important component of “inundation” more broadly. There is a seasonal component that is important to consider (i.e., areas that have no tidal inundation and no rainfall may be more hypersaline and hostile to establishment). Salinity - Chapman notes that there are correlations between salinity and presence of vegetation, but the relationships may be overstated. Soil composition - The texture of soils is extremely important as it relates to drainage and also aeration of the soil. The presence of sand within the soil can be extremely important; often have complete lack of oxygen within 5 cm soil depth (along channels as well). Presence of peat or other organic layers can greatly influence gas and water infiltration. The dark color of soils is related to iron sulfide production by anaerobic bacteria. Water table and drainage - The mean level of the water table has been found at some sites to increase as you move towards the shoreward section of the forest. There is very little movement with seasonal changes in tide (i.e., spring vs. neap tides), which may be related to the texture of the soil present. Some carbonate settings have extremely coarse substrates (majority of sand &gt; 2 mm). non NaCl soil chemistry - CEC is generally higher in the surface levels of the soil. Biota: Chapman provides 6 habitats in which biota exist, as an extension of MacNae. They most significant habitat for my particular research purposes are the ecosystem engineers, which would consist of the crustaceans that inhabit the canopies, the soil surface, and the soil itself. Further reading: Need to look up sulfur reduction processes. 3.2.2 Chapman, 1976, Ch. 9 “Ch. 9 - Physiology of mangroves” (Chapman 1976b) Physiology - Functioning Key contribution: This chapter provides a nice overview of the physiology of mangroves, primarily in relation to: Physiology of viviparous seedlings Physiology of the pneumatophores Physiology of salt control Osmotic pressures Transpiration rates Carbon assimilation rates Viviparous seedlings - The salinity of seedlings has been shown to be much lower than that of parent trees. This might increase buoyancy of the propagule and also protect it against very hostile environments. Seedlings quickly take up salts upon establishment, rapidly reaching to osmotic potentials of parent trees. Additionally, seedlings are found to be able to respire anaerobically. Respiration may be inhibited by several factors, such as presence of a fruit wall (A. marina) or the uptake of large concentrations of salts (R. mucronata). Pneumatophores - A number of studies have shown that pneumatophores are largely plant systems responsible for exchanges of gases. The discussion of pneumatophores here focused on three primary points: Gaseous exchange - Much of this is conducted through the lenticels, which may also occur on stilt roots. The individual pneumatophores are seen as being responsible for aerating the particular section of cable root it exists upon, as well as any stabilizing roots underneath. Respiratory function - Respiratory activity of pneumatophores likely makes up a significant (1/8 to 1/2) of total respiration. Other purposes - Pneumatophores may server other purposes besides gas exchange or respiration. For example: Sonneratia and Avicennia pneumatophores produce very fine roots near the surface of the soil which aid in absorbing nutrients. As sediment accretes, the lower rootlets cease functioning and new sets closer to the surface are produced. Older pneumatophores may exist primarily as support organs for the absorbing rootlets This is interesting in reference to carbon, soil accretion and biological contribution; it would be good to look into morphological differences of roots in mangroves. A review article? Salt control - Different strategies exist to deal with maintaining osmotic potentials and handling salts within mangroves. Salt exuding - Avicennia and Aegiceras spps. are able to exude salt from glands in leaves, which is an energy intensive process. These same species do not appear to exclude salt at the roots to the same degree that other species without salt secretion glands do. Exclusion at roots - Species without salt secretion glands maintain high osmotic potentials within their roots, which prevents much of the salt in the root system from entering the tree. Increasing leaf succulence - Differential rates of storage of water and salts in vacuoles and leaf tissues vary amongst species, as well as with tree age and also environmental salinity levels. The coupling of root exclusion and increasing leaf succulence may be primary mechanisms of handling salinity for non-secreting species. Osmotic pressures - Osmotic pressure is the tendency for water to enter a solution through osmosis. High OPs indicate a higher ability to take in water via osmosis. Interestingly, the OP in excess of sea water (i.e., effective OP) in mangroves is comparable to OP values in terrestrial species. When considering OP in mangroves, need to think of three compartments: OP in roots - uptake of water OP in leaves - transpiration and thus loss of water OP in vascular stem - flow rates within the plant For non salt-secreting species, the flow of water through the system is largely salt-free. OPs can vary within species depending on different salinity conditions, which might be reflected in succulence or other traits measurable by remotely sensed data (hyperspectral imagery). Transpiration rates - The transpiration rates of mangroves are reduced in saline conditions, and are affected by other environmental factors such as soil texture (e.g., more rapid transpiration from plants in sand than mud), but also depends on species. Evidence has been shown that transpiration rates are higher for Avicennia in presence of salt. Some researchers have considered mangroves as xerophytic systems (i.e., arid systems with lack of water), but others have attacked this in that mangroves receive continuous supply of water (though limited) and thus are not living in a water limited system. For non-mangrove species living in a mangrove ecosystem, xerophytic conditions are likely present. Carbon assimilation - The information provided here is cursory and simply points to a lack of information. Marilyn Ball has done much more work on this topic, particularly in relation to PWUE, and her articles should be referred to here. 3.2.3 Chapman, 1976, Ch. 10 3.2.4 Ball, 1988 “Ecophysiology of mangroves” (Ball 1988) Key significance: This is an excellent review of the ecophysiology (how the phyisology of the trees responds to their particular environment) of mangrove trees. This paper should be reviewed more than once. One of the key concepts to emerge from this study is: Mangroves have largely evolved to have large tolerances to salinity and inundation given the very dynamic environments in which they exist. Rather than evolving to exist in narrow niches, competition may drive zonation and thus the existence of multiple species in moderate stress environments. Key notes: Waterlogging - Key fact is that oxygen diffuses through air 10,000 times more rapidly than through water, thus root systems of mangroves are adapted such that they avoid extensive inundation through areal roots. degree of soil saturation effects form and availability of different nutrients – how specifically does this happen? may have different amounts of availability of P and N along the tidal gradient N primarily exists as ammonia in frequently tidal regions, which binds easily to organic compounds and thus persists within the soil system N exists primarily as nitrate in less frequently flooded zones, which is more prone to leaching. Typically find that these zones are P limited rather than N limited, however, which is easily absorped onto clay or precipitated with Ca, Al, or Fe Salinity - Important to remember that tolerance of salinity is largely dependent upon the developmental stage of the plant! The presence of cotyledonary reserves allow seedlings to persist in conditions that are otherwise inhospitable to them, but may not establish successfully following depletion of these reserves. Mangroves frequently classified according to three different mechanisms of tolerance: salt exclusion - all mangroves exclude salt at the root tips salt accumulation - all mangroves accumulate ions (though they show preferential differences for different ions) to maintain osmoregulation salt excretion - selective species have ability to excrete salts The particular salinity tolerance of a species may be particularly difficult to determine due to the species deriving water from sources other than surface water (i.e., freshwater underground seepage). Compartmentalization of ions is extremely important for maintaining biochemical processes, for example photosynthesis, especially for those species that are incapable of secreting salts. The ratio of Na+ / K+ is important in chloroplasts (cell of the leaf responsible for photosynthesis). Deficiencies in K+ concentration have been shown to result in loss of photosynthetic capability, particularly for Avicennia species. The major mechanism of ion transport into the transpiration system of the plant is through symplastic pathways (inside of plasma membrane where water and low-molecular-weight solutes can diffuse freely). Species of some genera (Acanthus, Aegialitis, Aegiceras and Avicennia) are capable of secreting salt from leaves. Photosynthesis - Most evidence points towards C3 photosynthetic pathways within mangrove species, however they exhibit very conservative water-use efficiencies relative to most C3 plants. Mangroves exhibit a variety of traits/mechanisms to manage water use efficiency while maintaining carbon assimilation. Three major leaf characteristics for maintaining leaf temperatures that vary among species are: leaf angle - affects radiant heat loading on the leaf and can be adjusted to reduce solar incidence leaf size - heat transfer is a function of the leaf geometry and wind speed; decreases in leaf size allows the leaf to maintain temperatures close to ambient temperatures, with sacrificing solar incidence heat capacity per unit area - a function of dry weight and water content per unit area; higher heat capacity buffers against warming of leaves A classic, hypothetical schematic of interspecific tolerances for salinity is shown below: Major tradeoffs - The two major tradeoffs that are seen in mangroves in relation to photosynthesis and salinity tolerances are: Salt exclusion during water uptake may induce significant carbon costs to the plant; often seen through more root biomass coupled with decrease in rate of water uptake High water use efficiency restricts rates of water efflux but also restricts rates of CO2 influx Relevant for research: differential amounts of root biomass may be seen along salinity gradients due to differing degrees of water use efficiency and maintenance of photosynthetic production - what are the implications for soil C? 3.2.5 McKee, 1993 “Soil physicochemical patterns and mangrove species distribution - reciprocal effects?” (McKee 1993) Key contribution: Methods: The study employed field and greenhouse analyses to examine the impacts of reducing soil conditions and sulphide presence on seedling growth. Field work was performed in Florida, with common zonation of R. mangle in the fringe forest and mixes of R. mangle and A. germinans in the basin forest that filters out to monospecific stands of A. germinans in the most landward basin. Soil samples were collected along transects directly next to Rhizophora prop roots, Avicennia pneumatophores, a mix of the two roots, as well as no roots for comparison of reducing soil conditions and sulphides. A factorial treatment arrangement for four flooding conditions on two species was designed in a greenhouse experimental setting to examine the effects of reducing conditions and sulfide on seedling growth, and vice versa. Key results: Field studies - Distinct zonation between both species composition and reducing soil conditions and sulphide were seen. Changes in Eh and sulphide concentration strongly correlated with shifts in species compositions. Higher Eh was found for mixed basin and fringe forest, whereas lower Eh was found with monospecific-basin Avicennia Higher sulphide concentrations were found in monospecific basin A. germinans region (contrasts with results of seedlings study). Greenhouse studies - Greatest difference in biomass growth between flooding treatments was seen belowground. A. germinans exhibited much lower growth in the flooded treatments relative to the drained treatment, whereas flooding stimulated belowground growth in R. mangle. Presence of sulphide had little effect on growth (AG or BG) of R. mangle, but was found to reduce AG and BG growth in A. germinans. Additionally, the presence of both species induced higher redox potential (Eh) relative to soils without any mangrove seedilings. Addition of sulphide induced a reduction in Eh. - This is likely due to O2 leaking from mangrove roots into the rhizosphere and thus inducing higher redox potentials - May also reduce buildup of sulphide through oxidation of sulphide in rhizosphere or inhibiting activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria Key conclusions: The authors make several key conclusions given their results: The results of the field and greenhouse experiments do not match, in that A. germinans was found in the portion of the forest with the highest sulphide conditions, but seedlings were found to be highly sensitive to low redox and high sulphide concentrations. Hypotheses are given that i) other controls on presence of R. mangle in this region are stronger than sulphide - A. germinans interactions, ii) may be a result of other factors (propagule dispersion, predation, competition), or iii) adult trees may exhibit different tolerances than seedlings The two-way effect of redox and sulphide on roots (and roots on redox) make it difficult to infer mechanistic processes from correlative studies Other notes: Seawater is the primary source of sulphate for reduction by dissimilatory sulphate reducing bacteria. H2S may be present in degrees to be toxic to mangroves, particularly seedlings. 3.2.6 McKee, 1995 “Seedling recruitment patterns in a Belizean mangrove forest” (McKee 1995) Key significance: This study examines the relative influence of edaphic and dispersal related characteristics on species patterning of mangroves in the Twin Cays (Belize). The study is unique in that it does well to look at the effects of multiple hypotheses (ecophysiology vs. dispersal properties) on zonation. Research design: Transects were laid perpendicular to the shoreline and extended through different “zones” of mangrove species. Plots were stablished along the transects and edaphic chracteristics as well as seedling densities and forest structure were collected. Additionally, tests of seedling growth were performed by transplanting individuals to forest plots of different mangrove parent species (but similar edaphic conditions). Propagules were collected and measured to examine dispersal properties. Key results: McKee concludes that different factors were more important for different species. In particular: R. mangle - Majority of variation in seedling density was explained by distance to parent trees, which would indicate dispersal properties were dominant controls A. germinans - Availability of resources, specifically light and NH4 explained majority of seedling density, indicating that nutrient limitations were primary controls. L. racemosa - A mix of dispersal and ecophysiological controls were found to explain seedling densities; however, seedlings were rare throughout the forest and thus the site conditions are likely too stressful for L. racemosa to exhibit canopy dominance. In relation to seedling survival, the following is concluded: dispersal and establishment properties (related to predation, dessication or inability to root) were primary causes of seedling mortality (i.e., during the establishment phase) following establishment, physico-chemical factors such as salinity, flooding or nutrient availability were found to largely determine survival of seedlings There are a number of nice figures that relate species zone to different criteria, but a nice visualization of quantifying relative density of species zonation is shown below (may be worth recreating for Krabi and Pak Panang): **Other notes:** McKee collects a number of edaphic variables (e.g., salinity, sulphide, redox potential, etc.) and then uses PCA to extract three ecologically relevant “factors” that she uses to associate with seedling establishment and survival: i) salinity, ii) inundation, and iii) nutrients/resources. This appears to be a clever way of dealing with emergent properties and controls on mangroves and may be of interest for further examining interactive factors. 3.2.7 Sherman, 1998 “Soil-plant interactions in a neotropical mangrove forest: Iron, phosphorus and sulfur dynamics” (Sherman, Fahey, and Howarth 1998) Key contribution: This study examines the interactions of species distribution and select nutrients along a 3 km transect in the Dominican Republic. Species distributions, nutrients and abiotic factors were found to covary along the transect, with different processes dominating pathways in the lower versus upper intertidal regions. Research design: A 3 kilometer transect was laid out through the forest and 14 permanent, 30 m radius plots were established to measure species composition and surface and soil water biogeochemistry from 6 different dates over a two year period. Key results: Salinity - The salinity levels along the transect decreased as the tidal influence decreased and the influence of fresh water from rivers increased. Additionally, salinity was found to be higher at soil depths of 50 cm than the surface water. Sulfate - Sulfate levels reflected changes in salinity. Sulfate was constant in concentration until 1700 m into the forest (the approximate reach of tidal inundation), at which poin it steadily declined. Sulfate concentrations were deeper in deep soil water than surface waters. Species presence - Presence of Rhizophora was significantly correlated with salinity and sulfate concentrations of deep soilwater; A. germinans was significantly negatively correlated with deep soilwater salinity and sulfate. L. racemosa was not correlated with salinity, but was significantly correlated with surface water total phosphorus. Many of the other surface water soil parameters were not correlated with species distributions. Key conclusions: The correlations between species distribution and soil chemistry parameters are not necessarily uni-directional. Others have shown that mangrove trees may have significant influence on the chemistry of the soil (e.g., McKee 1993 - oxidiation of rhizosphere which modifies redox potential and sulfide concentrations) The patterns across phosphorus, sulfate, alkalinity and pyrite (Fe) concentrations across the transect were found to be largely controlled by sulfate reduction and its associated chemical reactions. The nutrient dynamics of fringe vs basin forests vary, and are reflected in physiological strategies by different species. For example, R. mangle has higher nutrient resorption rates than A. germinans. Strong interactions appear to exist between hydrology, species distributions and soil dynamics. In the lower intertidal basin, physical processes appeared to dominate biogeochemical cycling because of high export rates of material. Chemical and biological processes in the upper intertidal region are more important given the lower amount of nutrient export. 3.2.8 Krauss, 2008 “Environmental drivers in mangrove establishment and early development: A review” (Krauss et al. 2008) Key contribution: This is likely the most comprehensive and up to date review of ecophysiology and mangrove development in mangroves. This should be reviewed several times. Five central paradigms - Krauss et al provide five central paradigms that shape a lot of the work thinking and work related to mangrove eco-physiology: Lack of a functional understory in most mangrove forests - often have seedlings and saplings, but no vines, herbaceous plants or shrubs. Several studies have concluded that terrestrial understory species have just not adapted shade or salinity tolerance (or both) Inundation classifications - studies have shown that species are found in distinctive zones, but also that many species of mangroves are capable of colonizing a wide range of inundation frequencies; one of the earliest definitions of inundation classes was given by Watson, 1928 Salinity tolerance, zonation and biomass allocation - Much of this work has been forwarded by M. Ball, e.g., see Ball 1988, Section 3.2.4. The interaction of inundation, salinity, soil saturation and fertility has been found to explain zonation in many instances, though not necessarily all. Mangrove zonation is a hypothesis-rich field. Interrelatedness of nutrient enrichment, growth and herbivory - Tradeoffs exist between slow growth, defense against herbivory and nutrient limitation. Field experiments may address nutrient limitation to understand growth rates and relative survival/establishment strategies Geomorphological classification - A number of geomorphological classifications have been proposed. Temperature - Temperature largely important for two considerations: Controls the geographical extent of mangroves globally (cold limits); different species have been shown to have different tolerances (Avicennia spp. typically seen in coldest conditions) Excessive heat can impact photosynthetic functioning and damage plants through direct cellular damage mechanistic understanding of how temperatures affect mangrove individuals (extreme heat or cold stress) is lacking and needs further research Atmospheric CO2 - For a given amount of nutrients, higher CO2 concentrations will often increases relative growth rates, however, the particular growth seen will likely vary significantly across species. Salinity - Salinity is one of the major environmental conditions that mangroves have to have evolved to be able to handle a wide range of conditions exist upon which mangroves have to be able to tolerate Given high salinity concentrations in the external environments, mangroves have to maintain osmotic potentials below these levels (~ -2.5 to -6.0 MPa). Inorganic molecules are stored in the vacuoles, whereas organic salt molecules are maintained in the non-vacuolar spaces to help regulate salinity and protect functioning. A variety of mechanisms exist to maintain photosynthesis under saline conditions, but the two are largely decoupled in that salt flux to leaves does not increase with higher transpiration. Light - Interactive effects between levels of light and salinity exist, thus need to consider the two in concert. The combination of the saline environment and high levels of solar incidence create a high risk for photoinhibition (in which solar incidence is greater than can be used and may damage functioning). Species of mangroves differ in their strategies to avoid photoinhibition, e.g., vertical leaf angles of Rhizophora spps whereas Bruguiera spps have larger xanthophyll pigment pools Biomass growth may change depending upon salinity vs. light levels, and may be different across species Presence of light gaps may be particularly important for certain species (e.g., Rhizophora). There are a number of studies beyond (Sherman, Fahey, and Battles 2000) that have investigated gap dynamics and are worth looking at. Nutrients - Mangrove ecosystems are largely nutrient limited ecosystems due to infertility of upland soils and often a lack of terrigenous input. Response of mangrove trees to nutrient additions are common to that of other forests, often with increased growth rates and reduced nutrient use efficiencies. Several traits of mangroves exist to deal with nutrient limitations: allocation of biomass to roots (particularly fine roots) relative to shoots large maternal reserves for propagules high amounts of nutrient resorption - resorption of nutrients from leaves prior to senescence high nutrient use efficiency for photosynthesis schlerophylly and tissue quality – reduces both decomposition and herbivory mutualistic associations, e.g., with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae or encrusting epibionts (?) In addition, different strategies exist for high nutrient environments: investment in leaf development and rapid growth rather than defense related traits high PWUE - high extraction of water which salinizes the soil and may exclude competitors The availability of nutrients vs other environmental conditions often induces tradeoffs among different species. Flooding and SLR - Flooding of mangroves greatly changes the soil conditions within very short time frames (less than a day). Mangrove roots may metabolize anaerobically for short periods of time, but more effective to avoid root hypoxia through internal aeration. Mangroves may aerate the rhizosphere through loss of O2 from roots, which oxidizes the soil and protects against harmful sulfide. The oxidized rhizosphere may also reduce flows of O2 from the plant to the soil during periods of inundation. However, mangroves are facultative halophytes and thus grow best under species-specific optimal levels of salinity and inundation, but growth levels generally are reduced under conditions beyond their particular optimum. Prolonged inundation, for example through sea level rise, reduces growth rates which may negate the effects CO2 fertilization. Over more short time periods, growth was reduced quickly but normal metabolic functioning quickly rebounded (after a period of a few weeks). Biota - Interacting effects of microconditions within the forest and biota, particularly insects or crabs that are predators of mangroves trees may be significant in establishement of seedlings. Additionally they can play important roles as ecosystem engineers, aerating soil, changing microtopography, or altering the texture of the soil. 3.2.9 Dangremond, 2015 “Environmental tolerances of rare and common mangroves along light and salinity gradients” (Dangremond, Feller, and Sousa 2015) References "],

["background.html", "4.1 Background", " 4.1 Background 4.1.1 Redox Reduction-oxidation (redox) describes the chemical processes by which electrons are transferred. Reduction and oxidation occur together, as electron is transferred from one (the reductant) to the other (the oxidant). Micro-organisms drive majority of redox reactions, often consuming electrons from C or accepting electrons from oxygen. Respiration is largely the consumption of C based electrons from carbohydrates. Basic example of respiration in which electrons are derived from an organic molecule: \\[CH_{2}O + H_{2}O = CO_{2} + 4e^-\\] The electrons cannot exist in independent form, and thus are run through metabolic cycles in organisms and dumped onto electron acceptors (e.g., O2). Oxygen is important within soils as it rapidly accepts electrons from other elements, which allows for metabolic processes. Aerobic respiration is performed on O2 (oxidize organic carbon) and release energy for metabolic activity. The redox potential of a soil is a measure of how well much oxidation-reduction it is able to perform (i.e., a measure of its ability to accept or donate electrons), and depends upon presence of electron acceptors as well as pH. Oxidizing soils - accept electrons easily Reducing soils - donate electrons easily Standard Eh levels for drained, well-aerated soils is in the 0.4 - 0.7 Volt range, whereas flooded conditions can reduce Eh levels to as low as -0.3 V. Other electron acceptors besides oxygen are: Nitrate - accepts 2 electrons when reduced from N(V) to N(III); reduces to N2 Manganese (VI) -&gt; reduces to Mn(II) Iron (III) -&gt; reduces to Fe(II) Sulfur (from SO42- to S2- (reduced)) Carbon (reduction of CO2 produces CH4) Electron acceptors are typically used up in this order (i.e., sulfur reduction is a process that occurs largely under very anaerobic soils). Anerobic systems result in the build up of reduced species The form of particular elements is important because it will change availability for uptake by plants (i.e., oxidized vs. reduced states). 4.1.2 Sulfur cycle Sulfur is particularly important in wetland ecosystems due to the anaerobic conditions of the soil and thus reliance on sulfur for metabolic activities.

["geomorphology-soils.html", "4.2 Geomorphology", " 4.2 Geomorphology 4.2.1 Thom, 1967 “Mangrove ecology and deltaic geomorphology: Tabasco, Mexico” (Thom 1967) A full summary of Thom, 1967 is provided in the “Zonation and Disturbance section.” Please refer to Section 3.1.2. From a geomorphological standpoint, this is one of the most well-cited studies arguing that mangrove vegetation patterns respond primarily to the hydrological and sedimentary conditions that exist within a given site. 4.2.2 Carlton, 1974 “Land building and stabilization of mangroves” (Carlton 1974) Key contribution: This is a perhaps less seminal paper but provides a brief review of the literature surrounding the ability of mangroves to “build” and “stabilize” shorelines. Much of the reviewed work is from Florida. Key conclusions: Carlton concludes more or less that mangroves do not “build” land per se, but are influential upon the rate at which sediments accrete on shorelines. In sum, two viewpoints exist: mangroves “build” land by accretion of sediments (a la Davis 1940) (UNSUPPORTED) mangroves modify the rate at which sediments accrete, thus affecting the speed of geomorphic change rather than the direction (Egler 1952, Gill 1971) (SUPPORTED) Further reading: Egler 1952 Gill 1971 4.2.3 Thom, 1982 “Mangrove ecology: A geomorphological perspective” (Thom 1982) Key contribution: This study is best known for the five environmental settings that Thom lays out for clastic (terrigenous) sediment deposition. The five environmental settings are detailed below: River dominated - Deltaic or estuarine settings in which significant sediment is transported from alluvial flows to the coastal region. The landscape is marked by numerous distributaries and interdistributary basins that vary in hydrology, particularly in regards to tidal influence. Tide dominated - Estuarine type settings in which the dominant hydrology is the bidirectional flow of tides. Often see sandy shoals within the estuary that are shaped parallel to the flow of tides. Wave dominated - Environmental settings in which flat shorelines accumulate sand barriers or cheniers that create lagoons and create regions of low-energy coastlines in which mangroves may establish. Sediment is primarily autochthonous. River &amp; wave composite - Settings in which both deltaic plains with strong alluvial influence as well as strong wave influences create a complex of alluvial fans and lagoons blocked by wave-distributed sand barriers from longshore flows. E.g., Tabasco, Mexico. Drowned river valleys - Estuaries or embayments that are underlain by impervious rock and have been flooded during the most recent period of sea level rise. Key knowledge: Thom describes the geomorphology of mangrove from three standpoints: Geophysical - The dominant physical processes that affect a landscape, such as SLR or climate Geomorphic - The dynamic history of the land in response to the dominant geophysical factors. Can be broken into three scales: macro: clastic vs. carbonate sediments meso: dominant physical process (tide vs. riverine vs. wave) micro: microtopographic features such as drainage and elevation that produce environmental gradients Biological - Factors such as biogeography or competition that affect the landscape Additionally, Thom notes that his five suggested geomorphig settings are not comprehensive but are rather representative of dominant processes that may be relevant. Thom goes on to discuss variations and scale in time and space and their resultant effects on mangrove geomorphology. He concludes that zonation of mangrove species responds opportunistically to geomorphic setting, and areas with high geomorphic diversity will have high degrees of habitat variation. Topics to think about further: How do geomorphic settings related to soil texture and soil carbon? 4.2.4 Woodroffe, 1983 “Development of mangrove forests from a geological perspective” (Woodroffe 1983) Key contribution: This paper describes the development of an autochthnous, geomorphically inactive mangrove forests on Grand Cayman island. The study takes a geological perspective in that they examine soil depths and soil cores throughout the west peninsula, and reconstruct models of autochthonous development of the mangrove forest through time. Key findings: The study concludes that there were key tidal inlets which were eventually breached my rising sea levels and allowed for expanded colonization of the calcerous bedrock by mangroves. Soil depths &amp; cores indicate that there was a forest of landlocked mangroves at one point during low-levels (200 cm below present), but the authors are unsure of how tidal fluxes reached this area. 4.2.5 Thom, 1984 “Coastal landforms and geomorphic processes” (Thom 1984) Key contribution: This is an extension of (Thom 1982), in which Thom describes three carbonate settings. The conclusions are largely the same as (Thom 1982), and thus refer to section 4.2.3 for them. Key additions: The carbonate settings that Thom adds to his original five clastic settings are as follows: Carbonate platform - Accumulation of lime muds and peat on low-energy tropical coasts. Oftentimes the fringing mangroves are against large, open, shallow bodies of water. Coral reef or sand barriers may block wave and tidal energy to produce low-energy conditions Sand/shingle barrier - Mangroves may form on the cemented or non-cemented coral detritus, for example patchy mangroves colozining portions of the Great Barrier Reef. Sand mostly consists of carbonate particles and sea levels play an important part on depositional characteristics Carbonate embayments - Embayments in which soil “crusts” were submerged by SLR during Holocene. E.g., patchy mangroves on old reef complexes that are highly variable and reflect varability in the substrate complexity. Key knowledge: In addition, Thom discusses some of the prior models of succession and zonation in mangroves. In particular he identifies three trends of research, including one in which he situates himself: “Classical succesional view of mangroves” - The “Davis 1940” view of mangroves that emphasizes the role of biota rather than geophysical or geomorphological processes “Environmental gradient view” - The more “ecological niche” based view of vegetation patterning that results from environmental gradients; Watson 1928 was one of first studies to argue for this effect “Physiographic ecology” - regards physical and botanical landscapes as mosaics of landforms that result from differential effects of physical processes on different materials, and the promotion of different biological communities in response to them focused at landscape scale, geomorphic variety produces variety in biological assemblages Other reading: Snedaker, 1982 - Mangrove species zonation: Why? 4.2.6 Woodroffe, 1990 “The impact of sea-level rise on mangrove shorelines” (Woodroffe 1990) Key contribution: This review by Woodroffe discusses the impacts of relative sea level rise as it was projected at the time on mangroves. There has since been 27 years worth of research in this topic, and thus it’s important to couple this study with more recent papers. Crux of the issue - “order of rates of sea-level rise that have been predicted would in some cases lead to major disruption of mangrove forests” Key notes: ability of mangrove forests to respond to different levels of sea level rise depends on coastal morphology steep cliffs (e.g., mid-oceanic atolls) may not be able to respond due to lack of ability to migrate along shoreline as well as distant propagule sources for recolonization Eustatic patterns during Holocene have varied regionally in Indian and Pacific Oceans, rose to approximately 1-2 m above present levels, before falling and stabilizing at current levels in West Indies and Southern US, increasingly risen though at decelerating rates to arrive at period of stability of today mangroves are effective indicators of past sea-level if species with given preference for position in intertidal zone can be identified within paleosedimenets however, often not clear because of compaction and contamination with younger aged organic matter given sea level rise, the ability of mangrove forests to persist may be largely dependent upon the catchment size of deltas (i.e., size of area from which water and sediments drain) carbonate settings are at higher risk of undergoing regime shifts relative to deltaic or estuarine mangroves Woodroffe combines Thom’s environmental settings into three primary classes of geomorphological development: river dominated tide dominated carbonate He expounds on them in this article, whereas he summarizes them in his review in Tropical Mangrove Ecosystems (see Section @(woodroffe1992)). 4.2.7 Woodroffe, 1992 “Mangrove sediments and geomorphology” (Woodroffe 1992) Key contribution: This is a key synthesis of knowledge related to geomorphology and environmental settings in mangroves. Woodroffe gives an overview of sedimentation and shoreline progradation / erosion, followed by a review of Thom’s environmental settings and Lugo and Snedaker’s mangrove habitats. He concludes the article with a review of stratigraphy and paleoecology, with particular reference to mangrove responses to relative sea level rise. Key findings: For Thom’s clastic environmental settings, refer to Section 4.2.3 For Thom’s carbonate environmental settings, refer to Section 4.2.5 For Lugo and Snedaker’s functional habitats, refer to Section 3.1.3 Diagrams of Thom’s environmental settings are provided below: Stratigraphy and paleoecology: Quaternary period (~past two million years) comprised of: Holocene (~11,700 YBP) sea level has been approximately stable for 6,000 years sea level was rising rapidly from approximately 10,000 - 6,000 YBP though there is likely regional variation Pleistocene (~2.5 mil to 11,700 YBP) Sediments deposited during Holocene are well preserved and contain structures &amp; fossils that are useful, whereas sediments deposited during Pleistocene are less well preserved sea level rise on more gradually sloping coasts likely resulted in significant fluctuation of mangrove forests, whereas carbonate atolls (e.g., on coral) likely disappeared during high sea levels or were restablished during low sea levels transgression - landward movement of shoreline during periods of sea level rise regression - seaward movement of shoreline during periods of sea level subsidence there are also iteractions with progradation and erosion that may reverse processes at specific locations Woodroffe examines three patterns of tropical geomorphological development: tropical deltas that are river dominated (poorly studied as of 1992) estuarine embayments that are tide-dominated Progradational model - estuary shoreline gradually build into estuary and is generally fringed by mangroves Big swamp model - rapid accumulation of sediment as sea level stabilizes followed by vertical accretion and conversion to other types; differs from progradational model in that there’s little age difference between mangrove sediments Barrier estuary/mud basin - sand reworked from seward shelf and forms sandy barrier or flood tidal delta; lagoon is sink for fluvial sand and mud from terrestrial sources by rivers carbonate banks or reefs predominantly characterized by in situ production of sediments Note: This is a key study that would be good to review again later. 4.2.8 McKee, 2007 “Caribbean mangroves adjust to rising sea level through biotic controls on change in soil elevation” (McKee, Cahoon, and Feller 2007) Key contribution: This is a very well-cited study that experimentally examples biological controls on soil elevation in mangroves of the Meso American Barrier Reef (in Belize). Study design: The authors installed elevation rods with rod surface elevation tables (RSETs) that were able to measure changes in elevation from a baseline over the course of three years in fringe, transition and interior mangroves. They examined the effects of nutrient additions (N, P &amp; a control) across three transects at three replicate sites. In addition, they laid a sand horizon in a plot adjacent to the RSETs and used cores to monitor subsurface accretion, allowing for differentiation between subsurface accretion and surface accretion of biomass to elevation. Finally, the authors examine several cores (up to 10m in depth) across sites throughout the Caribbean to examine relative SLR and mean soil accretion. Key results: The authors conclude that the fringe portion of the forests are able to keep pace with sea level rise, primarily due to subsurface accumulation of biomass (significantly correlated with elevation change). The fringe zone was found to have significantly positive gain in elevation, with majority from subsurface change, whereas interior and transition zones saw subsidence. Elevation gains were seen across all sites for P addition, whereas elevation gain was variable in directino for N (negative in interior). The authors give three key points: Rates of modern change in elevation may vary in both direction and magnitude within forests Elevation changes vary in relation to physico-chemical gradients that may control natural productivity of mangroves Elevation changes due to variation in nutrients are variable in both direction and magnitude The key results in elevation change across treatments are shown below: The results from the mangrove peat cores showed that peat accumulation corresponded with rates of SLR over the past 6,000-7,000 years. Although they are currently keeping pace with sea level rise, the cores show that at points (in which SLR exceeded 5 mm / yr), mangroves were lost from the area. Thus, the presence of mangroves at these sites depends on relative SLR rates (eustatic rise plus local subsidence). Rates of mangrove peat accretion, however, may underestimate ability to respond to SLR as these are often based on mean rates from historical records that likely fluctuate significantly in response to SLR. 4.2.9 Woodroffe, 2016 “Mangrove sedimentation and response to relative sea level rise” (Woodroffe et al. 2016) Key contribution: This study is a review of sedimentary processes and geomorphology with a particular focus on their responses to relative sea level rise. The study introduces the concept of the accomodation space in the context of mangroves, which is the space available for potential sediment accumulation. Notes: Considering processes at different scales: Macroscale - processes at the landscape level (environmental setting a la Thom) Climate, eustatics Mesoscale - habitat level (fringe, basin, etc. a la Lugo and Snedaker) Hydrodynamics, sediment supply (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) Microscale - individual tree or plot level Interactions between surface elevation, geomorphic processes (accretion vs. compaction), and biological processes (BGB production) A nice summary of interactions between sedimentology, hydrology and biology: “The distribution of mangrove species coincides with the intertidal accomodation space, which progressively fills through sediment accumulation. Emergent properties and biocomplexity are a function of hydroperiod and are related to salinity and flooding tolerance, the latter of which is related to root morphologies, physiology, and reproductive traits such as vivipary.” Accomodation space - the space available for potential sediment accumulation. Typically see highest accomodation space at shoreline in mangroves, though it may be highly variable (e.g., basin areas that are only flooded during highest tides). may distinguish between mineral vs. biological accretion, and thus may consider “ecological accomodation space” Rates of sedimentation depend upon the accomodation space, which depends on hydrology and other factors. In the short term, the rate of sediment deposition appears independent of rate of SLR. The accomodation space is directly constrained by upper limit of tidal flooding. Focusing on vertical adjustment within a mangrove forests risks missing broader regional picture in that mangroves have constantly shifted position throughout time, and thus there may be natural fluctuations with sea level rise that can maintain existence as well as are potentially key climate change mitigation opportunities.

Key findings: the spectral and spatial composition of mangrove species and vegetation assemblages has complicated use of multispectral (broadband) imagery; hyperspectral (narrowband) imagery is promising but more difficult to access spectral signatures of different wetland veg are often similar, and are “muddied” by spectral reflectance from soil, hydrologic regime or atmospheric conditions spectral signatures affected most strongly by biochemical and biophysical properties of leaves, which vary greatly across species discrimination of wetland species from Landsat TM or SPOT imagery has generally been insufficient due to: lack of fine, ecological divisions between vegetation species broad nature of spectral wavebands lack of high spectral and spatial resolution to detect subcanopy vegetation types ANNs and fuzzy classification techniques have shown promise in better classifying mixed species pixels most important biochemical and biophysical properties characterizing wetland species are: chlorophyll - green pigment biomass concentration - biophysical prop leaf water content major issue of using vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) to estimate biomass is the saturation problem Mutanga and Skidmore (2004) propose one mechanism to resolve saturation problem building spectral libraries via hyperspectral sensors is critical for discriminating wetland species, but also needs investigation at different sites &amp; scales as reflectance within species may vary depending on environmental conditions Research ideas: Spectral imagery can be effective in monitoring plant water content, which may vary significantly across mangrove species due to differing water use efficiencies Further reading: 5.1.3 Heumann, 2011 “Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities” (Heumann 2011) Key contribution: One of several reviews of mangroves and remote sensing techniques that focuses primarily (i.e., solely) on vegetation mapping. Key findings: Spectral discrimination of different species not successful using multispectral (broadband) imagery (Ramsey and Jensen, 1996). Mixed pixels also an issue for discriminating species as well as estimating canopy structure Spectral saturation at high biomass values is a particular problem for mapping biomass and volumes Very high resolution imagery effective at reducing mixed pixels just due to smaller size OBIA has typically been applied to species discrimination rather than extent of mangrove mappings Quickbird and IKONOS sensors are most common for very high resolution imagery due to long-term archiving of data multispectral sensors but show improvement over Landsat TM or ETM+ due to reduced numbers of mixed pixels Use of spectral data only is often insufficient for discrimination of species Classification accuracies are greatly improved when other image properties are considered, such as texture Texture analaysis has been applied to species discrimination, but has not been investigated (as of 2011) for other forest characteristics C-band PolSAR has lowest ability to parse forest structure of SAR bands Mangrove biomass specific findings: Canopy height and biomass have been shown to be strongly correlated in mangroves (e.g., Fromard et al., 1998; Smith and Whelan, 2006) must studies of height and biomass have employed SAR data different polarizations (based on wavelength) interact differently with different components of the forest trunks and soils may produce single or double bounce interactions signal may scatter within canopy P-band POLSAR or HV polarization of L-band SAR perform best in mapping aboveground biomass Very-high resolution satellites: The IKONOS and Quickbird are most commonly used, due to archiving of data and plans for long-term consistency IKONOS &gt; GeoEye-1 (successor) (multispect @ 1.65 m and panchrom @ 0.41 m) Quickbird &gt; Worldview-2 (successor) (&lt;2m multi, &lt;0.5 m panchrom) note that Worldview-2 has 8 multispectral channels, including those in yellow and red edge ranges designed for veg studies Research ideas: Coupling of species mapping with species-specific allometry equations for better estimates of mangrove biomass Might make sense in Americas where just three species exist (easier!) 5.1.4 Kuenzer, 2011 “Remote sensing of mangrove ecosystems: A review” (Kuenzer et al. 2011) Key contribution: This is a very extensive review of remote sensing and mangroves. Notes: Optical imagery: The spectral signature of mangrove leaves are largely a function of age, vitality, phenological props and physiological props. Greater discrimination between species (at least in Vietnam) may be seen in the NIR, but little differentiation seen in VIS: Radar imagery: SAR imagery provides intensity values of the “backscatter coefficient”. Given different polarizations and wavelengths of SAR scanning, different interactions with mangrove landscape occur. The different SAR bands are as follows: X-band - 3 cm wavelength, effective for direct backscatter from canopy C-band - 6 cm, plant/soil multiple and volume scattering L-band - 24 cm, direct backscatter from soil &amp; water Sensors: See Table 2 in the study for an extensive list of sensors used within remote sensing of mangrove studies Aerial imagery is limited in that it cannot be scaled beyond immediate site/locality, but has value in that it can provide high-resolution data particularly for hard to access sites without field data. High spatial resolution data (IKONOS &amp; Quickbird) Ultimate goal is to map mangroves at the species level A comparison of IKONOS and QuickBird found IKONOS (4 m) to be more effective at discriminating in species because of the higher spectral resolution. QuickBird has higher spatial resolution (1 m) but was less useful in this particular investigation (Greg’s paper). Hyperspectral imagery identifying relevant bands is a time intensive process and many bands are highly correlated EnMAP sensor satellite hyperspectral data that will provide more access to hyperspectral datasets globally is this online? I’m not sure yet. Several tables are given in the paper that describe the various data sensors and platforms and their relative benefits and limitations for remote sensing of mangroves. Needs within RS of mangroves space: The authors call for several needs within the remote sensing of mangrove space: Need for homogenized classification schemes - ontologies, e.g., what is a sparse versus dense mangrove Need for standardized data-processing models - standardiziing preprocessing, processing and post processing such that enhanced comparability of studies is enabled Need for homogenized transparent accuracy assessment - self explanatory Need for further investigations of synergistic data use - coupling of new, novel and disparate RS datasets to investigate novel research questions Need for ecosystem service assessments Need for interdisciplinary and well-networked research teams 5.1.5 Giri, 2016 “Observation and monitoring of mangrove forests using remote sensing: Opportunities and challenges” (Giri 2016) Key contribution: This is an introductory piece to a special issue on monitoring mangroves using RS.

["vegetation.html", "5.2 Vegetation", " 5.2 Vegetation 5.2.1 Ramsey, 1996 “Remote sensing of mangrove wetlands: Relating canopy spectra to site-specific data” (Ramsey and Jensen 1996) Key significance: This is one of the earliest comprehensive attempts to relate multispectral wavelength data to mangrove forest structure characteristics. In particular, the study seeks out to answer two primary questions: What are the spectral and structural changes within and between mangrove species and community types? What are the relationships between the canopy spectral variability at the blue, green, red and NIR wavelength regions and canopy species composition and structural variability? Their results largely showed that remote sensing of species composition is quite difficult (no relationships between species composition and spectral indices exist), but LAI and a few other parameters (canopy height) were found to be significantly correlated with some spectral bands/vegetation indices. Research design: Field structure and species composition data was collected and coupled with remotely sensed spectral data. Regression and other statistical techniques were used to relate the data to the various spectral measures and their arithmetic transforms. Spectral measurements were taken in the lab, from a helicopter platform, and also from SPOT satellite. Key notes &amp; results: The following results and key conclusion of the study should be noted: LAI was calculated as a transform of canopy closure, which was collected with a hemispherical mirror Significant correlations of any of the bands with percent species composition was not significant The strongest correlations between spectral signatures and forest structure data was with LAI LAI was not significantly correlated with species composition, but was significantly correlated with forest height, which indicates that canopy depth expands with increasing canopy height. 5.2.2 Green, 1998 “Remote sensing techniques for mangrove mapping” (Green et al. 1998) Key significance: The study reviews common methods of remote sensing for mangrove mapping, with a particular emphasis on the fact that accuracy assessments are rarely performed following classification of RS mangrove imagery. The authors then couple the most commonly used techniques with accuracy assessments using field-based data to examine the relative strengths &amp; weaknesses of the different techniques. Research design: The study employs three spectral image datasets (Landsat 6 TM, SPOT, and Airborne multispectral data at 1 m resolution) for generating of RS imagery of mangroves in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The review of classificatin of spectral imagery for mangroves identifies 5 different methodologies: Visual interpretation - the user classifies areas, though often with a radiometric enhancement applied to the imagery Vegetation index - different vegetation indices can be employed such as ratio indices (NDVI) or orthogonal indices (tasseled cap transformations); this study uses NDVI with a ISODATA clustering algorithm producing 50 classes that are identified and edited to match mangroves Unsupervised classification - may or may not involve image enhancement; this study used ISODATA clustering algo on unenhanced imagery Supervised classification - most common method of mangrove classification and may or may not include image enhancement (e.g., enhancing edges between stands or species types); this study uses 3 x 3 edge enhancement filter applied to imagery, useful in mangroves given linear nature PCA and band ratios - ratios of different bands can be effective in distinguishing different landscape features; this study uses the ratios of various Landsat and SPOT bands, runs PCA, and then generates an image based on the most significant PCAs (which they then classify) Accuracy assessment was performed using three metrics (following Congalton, 1991): Overall accuracy - overall agreement as sum of correctly labelled sites divided by total number of sites User accuracy - probability that a classified pixel actually represents that category on the ground [3. Producer accuracy - how often real features on ground are shown correctly on the map; NOT used in this study] Tau coefficient - indicates the percent of pixels classified correctly than would be expected by chance alone Key results: The authors largely justify the work based on: A lack of widespread accuracy assessments within the literature A discussion of the limitations of climate on spectral RS imagery classification (although their methods only examine spectral datasets; they give SAR a head nod in the review section) Discrimination of mangrove vs. non-mangrove vegetation: SPOT XS imagery was not effective at producing accurate classifications of mangrove extent. CASI (airborne) data was highly effective at identifying mangrove vegetation (with all five methods producing overall accuracies greater than 50%), whereas methods performed on Landsat data improved markedly with increased computational sophistication (i.e., method 5). Accurate classification of Landsat data required the calculation of PCs and band ratios, rather than processing of just raw band data. In general, visual identification and ratio index based classifications are not effective at classifying mangroves. Additionally, merging of Landsat TM and SPOT XP (i.e., down-sampling Landsat data) was found to be effective at improving mapping classifications (using both a principle components merge, as well as an intensity-hue-saturation merge). Discrimination of mangrove habitats: The results show that the airborne spectral data (CASI) was most effective at accurately classifying 9 different mangrove classes. Reasonable classification accuracies could be achieved with the Landsat data for a reworking of just three mangrove classes (tall Rhizophora, other mangrove, and non-mangrove), but were highly inaccurate for a 9-class map. Note: There is a nice table of other works on mangrove mapping and remote sensing in the introduction. It may be good to review this table again at a later date. 5.2.3 Proisy, 2000 “Interpretation of polarimetric radar signatures of mangrove forests” (Proisy et al. 2000) Key contribution: This study reviews the interaction of backscattering signals of different polarizations of SAR data with components of a mangrove forest. Research design: The study took field-based data on forest structure and species composition, as well as collected data from the P-, L-, and C-Bands of AIRSAR data (NASA JPL; airborne SAR). The calculated a number of backscattering coefficients for each of the polarizations (HH, VV and HV), as well as the copolarization ratio (VV/HH) as well as two cross-polarization ratios (HH/HV and VV/HV). The different bands were acquired a mean incidence angle of 35 degrees at: P-band: 0.44 GHz L-band: 1.25 GHz C-band: 5.3 GHz Key findings: Within the L-band, surface scattering or double-bounce effects dominate up until approximately 150-200 Mg/ha, whereas volume scattering (i.e., within the canopy) dominates for biomass values greater than 150-200 Mg/ha. The dominant contributer to the backscattering coefficient depends on the type of forest being monitored. For example: Mature or declining stands with biomass greater than 300 Mg/ha have volume scatter at all frequencies. Mature or declining stands with biomass between 100 - 300 Mg/ha have dominant volume scattering at C-band, volume and double-bounce scattering at L-band, and double-bounce scattering at P-band Pioneer stages with less than 100 Mg/ha biomass have volume scattering present in all three polarizations of C-band, double-bounce or surface scattering at L-band, and all three present (though interaction term is strongest) at the L-band for all three polarizations. Overall, P-band provides most pronounced polarimetric signatures, and is the most useful for distinguishing between different scattering mechanisms and thus different forest stages. A nice summary figure of the interactions between forest structure and radar returns is below: Notes: Prior studies have found that there is a strong positive relation between SAR backscattering coefficients and total biomass, particularly for P-HV and L-HV. The main contributions to the total backscattering coefficient response are i) the soil scattering component, ii) the volume scattering component, and iii) the double-bounce scattering component. 5.2.4 Proisy, 2002 “On the influence of canopy structure on the radar backscattering mangrove forests” (Proisy et al. 2002) Key significance: One of a series of studies by Proisy et al, this particular study examines two mangrove forest stands of near identical aboveground biomass, but markedly different forest structure. They examine the polarimetric SAR data that they collect from the two plots, and examine them in relation to the two different forest structures. The forest structures both contain ~75 Mg biomass/ha, but are structured as: A pioneer stand of L. racemosa that is extremely dense (~12,000 trees/ha) and has much higher basal area (21.0 m2/ha) A declining stand with two canopy strata: A. germinans that are dying off and form an open, tall canopy (250 trees/ha, 4.2 m2/ha &amp; 19 m height) R. mangle that are replacing the A. germinans (31 trees/ha, 0.2 m2/ha &amp; 8 m height) Research design: The same research methods as (Proisy et al. 2000) (see Section 5.2.3) were employed, but this particular study focused on an in-depth comparison of two plots with similar aboveground biomass values, but markedly different forest structure characteristics. Key results: Overall, the backscattering from the open stand was higher than that of the closed (pioneer) stand. With the help of a polarimetric scattering model, they found that the three primary contributers to backscattering (volume vs. interaction vs. surface scattering) differed between the two stands for select polarizations. Additionally, they note two key concluding remarks: Use of correlation backscatter to biomass relationships should be restricted to homogeneous closed canopies. Distinguishing between stands of different developmental status should be possible via differences in backscaterring coefficients of the different SAR bands and polarizations A key figure that shows some of these differences is shown below: 5.2.5 Mutanga, 2004 “Narrow band vegetation indices solve the saturation problem in biomass estimation” (Mutanga and Skidmore 2004) Key significance: This study addresses the issue of vegetation index saturation at high biomass levels, and examines the effectiveness of hyperspectral data for resolving the issue. The study is largely motivated given that the “major limitation of using vegetation indices is asymptotic approach of a saturation level after a certain biomass density or LAI” Red edge - The rise of reflectance at the boundary between chlorophyll absorption in red wavelengths and leaf scattering in NIR wavelengths (680-750 nm). Red edge position can be defined as the point of maximum slope on the red infrared curve, and can be calculated by identifying the maximum of the first derivative Research design: The study primarily focuses on two approaches to resolving the saturation issue with biomass and vegetation indices: Use of narrow band vegetation indices, which are simply NDVI, Simple Ratio (SR) and Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI), but for 637 bands of hyperspectral data (350-2500 nm) Use of the red edge position A grass was grown in a greenhouse with two different nitrogen treatments (and one control group), and hyperspectral signatures were repeatedly taken. The various indices are computed for narrow band vegetation indices as well as indices using the red edge position. Key results: NDVI - The results clearly indicate an improvement in a relationship between biomass and an NDVI index derived from red edge spectral bands rather than standard (NIR and red) bands. SR - The results from the SR tests are similar to that of NDVI; reconstruction of SR using all possible hyperspectral band combinations indicates that bands from the red edge portion are most sensitive to changes in biomass TVI - Although distribution of the R2 values for reconstruction of this index differed visually from that of NDVI and SR (which were quite similar), the most efficient TVI was found to be constructed from bands in the red edge portion of the spectrum. The green portion of the spectrum also did well (e.g., second “best”) in reconstructing the vegetation indices. Red edge position - The red edge position was found to have a high correlation coefficient with biomass, indicating there is a significant correlation Of the three vegetation indices, SR was found to have the strongest correlation with biomass. Thus, narrow band derivations of SR from the red edge portion of the wavelength spectrum may be most efficient in estimating biomass from spectral data. 5.2.6 Wang, 2004a “Comparison of IKONOS and QuickBird images for mapping mangrove species on the Caribbean coast of Panama” (Wang et al. 2004) Key contribution: This study employs high resolution IKONOS (Space Imaging) and QuickBird (DigitalGlobe) imagery for improved mapping of mangrove species at Punta Galeta, Panama. In particular the study seeks to compare the imagery sources across three primary criteria: Spectral quality using subjective visual inspection and overall spectral statistics Classification effectiveness using multispectral bands with and without panchromatic bands Classification effectiveness following inclusion of textural information Research design: IKONOS (4 m multi, 1 m pan) and QuickBird (2.8 m multispec, 0.7 m panchrom) imagery were bought for the region and geometrically corrected. Training and validation plots for the major land cover classes (red, white, and black mangroves, roads, lagoons, and rainforest) were established and data were collected. MLC was used for classification of imagery using four multispectral bands, as well as a resampled panchromatic band at the resolution of the multispectral band resolution. Additionally, spectral information using the high resolution data of the imagery were computed and included within the classification algorithms. Two “order” textural layers were derived: A first order layer that was a simple measure of local variance within different sized rectangular neighborhoods that were coupled with the multispectral bands. A second order layer that uses a gray-level co-occurrence matrix to derive three features: contrast, correlation and entropy (see Clausi, 2002) Finally, an object-based approach was employed using the second order texture data. The image was segmented into objects, and then classification was applied to the resultant objects. Key results: The results generally show that the high resolution multispectral datasets were effective in accurate classifications of mangrove species. In particular: Standard deviation and entropy of the multispectral data for IKONOS was consistently higher than that of QuickBird, indicating that IKONOS captures richer spectral information than QuickBird Classification using purely multispectral data was slightly better for IKONOS than QuickBird Addition of the panchromatic band did not significantly improve accuracies Inclusion of a first order texture band improved accuracies for the IKONOS image; HOWEVER, accuracies decreased for QuickBird imagery, with the exception of the largest window size Second order texture data did not produce accurate classifications by themselves Under the object-based approach (using textural information in panchromatic and multispectral bands), almost equivalent classification accuracies were achieved It is important to note that the results do not support the expectation that the slightly higher spatial resolution of QuickBird imagery would result in “better” textural information for classification accuracies. Further reading: Textural analyses: Clausi, 2002 - An analysis of co-occurrence texture statistics as a function of grey level quantization Haralick et al, 1973 - Textural features for image classification 5.2.7 Wang, 2004b “Integration of object-based and pixel-based classification for mapping mangroves with IKONOS imagery” (Wang, Sousa, and Gong 2004) Key significance: This is a sister study to the study reviewed in Section @(wang2004a). This study sought to examine three different classification methods: MLC at the pixel level Nearest neighbor classification at the pixel level A hybrid classification that combines pixel and object based methods (MLCNN) The consider the conundrum that with increasing spatial resolution, the number of detectable sub-class elements increases as well and thus classification at the pixel level may deteriorate. Thus, they examine object-based classification as a means of getting around this particular issue. Research design: For the site and imagery description see Section @(wang2004a). The different classification approaches used in this study are described here: MLC at pixel level - Object-based classification - Used eCognition 3.0 software (region merging technique that uses a homogeneity criteria to detemine whether pixels and regions should be merged). The merging “breaks off” at a predetermined parameter (small param = small regions, large param = large regions), and there are in principle infinite choices of break-off parameters* The authors develop a joint procedure in which MLC at pixel level is first used, in which spectrally inseparable classes are identified, and all spectrally separable classes are masked out. An object-based classification procedure is then performed on the spectrally inseparable classes. * To deal with the issue of infinate scale parameters, Wang et al develop a method to identify an optimal value. They use the training set data from the MLC image, reclassify all other pixels as 0s, and then use the image segmentation approach for several scale parameters. They then derive the pairwise Bhattacharya Distance values for the seven land cover classes at each scale, and select the scale at which BD reaches a maximum. Key results: In general, the accuracy of the classifications were relatively high for all three methods; however, the mixed pixel and object-based method performed the best. The key results are: The pixel based approach generally did well in correctly classifying the land cover classes (88.9% overall accuracy), with the exception of the red mangroves (71.3% accuracy), black mangroves (81.8%) and rainforest (81%) The object-based approach improved classification of the rainforest (100%0), red mangroves (77.5%) and black mangroves (89.8%), but greatly misclassified white mangroves (21.9%) due to their existence along edges with red and black and thus being pulled into “objects”; overall accuracy was relatively lower relative to the pixel based approach as a result (80.4%) The mixed pixel and object-based method performed the best because white mangrove, road, gap and lagoon all were highly separable using MLC, but distinguishing between red mangrove, black mangrove and rainforest benefitted from the object-based method (due to high confusion between these classes) The mixed method approach achieved overall classification accuracies of 91.4%. Key conclusions: The following conclusions are of particular note: The pixel-based method retains the spectral information at a fine spatial scale, but does not excel at distinguishing between spectrally similar classes (rainforest, red &amp; black mangrove) The object-based method averages spectral information, but in doing so is able to improve discrimination between spectrally similar regions (the difficult classes mentioned above) However, you run the risk of averaging unrelated pixels (likely unavoidable) 5.2.8 Vaiphasa, 2005 “Tropical mangrove species discrimination using hyperspectral data: A laboratory study” (Vaiphasa et al. 2005) Key contribution: At the time this study was written, hyperspectral studies of mangrove species classifications were relatively limited, and fairly inconclusive. This study soeeks to examine whether mangrove canopy leaves have sufficient spectral information to discriminate mangroves at the species level. Sixteen mangrove species were examined. Research design: Canopy leaves from 16 species were collected in Chumphon and hyperspectral signatures at 2151 spectral bands from 400 - 2500 nm were collected in laboratory conditions. One way ANOVA was used to examine for differences of individual species from one another across all spectral bands, and spectral separability of the species using a Jeffries-Matusita distance analysis metric. Given the issue of a massive feature space (2151 bands), four “optimal” bands for assessing spectral separability were identified using a wrapper feature selection approach. Key results: The results generally show that discrimination between the sixteen species is generally achievable. Some particular key results include: 1941 of the 2151 bands were found to be spectrally dissimilar across all species (ANOVA analysis) at th p &lt; 0.05 level. Of these 1941, 477 bands were significant at the &lt; 0.01 level. The exceptions were primarily at the UV region (350-400 nm) and the shortwave infrared region (1800-2500 nm), where lighting conditions may have played an influential role. The optimal band combination for classification was found to be: 720 nm, 1277 nm, 1415 nm and 1644 nm These results indicate that other properties beyond pigment (which would correspond to the 720 nm band) may play important roles in discrimination, and may be a result of other ecophysiological factors (water content, salinity, sugar, protein, oil, lignin, cellulose, leaf structure, etc.) Pair-wise separability of mangrove species was possible for many of the species using these four bands and the J-M distance metric, but reduced separability was seen for species of the Rhizophoraceae family. There was high confusion both amongst species within Rhizophoraceae, as well as with S. ovata, X. granatum and Pluchea indica.

The study finds that classification accuracies are increased significantly, from 76.04% to 88.21%. Research design: The study coupled an existing mangrove species map produced from classification of ASTER imagery with a map of pH throught Pak Panang mangroves to examine the effectiveness of a post-classifier. In particular, they collected 200 pH measurements distributed throughout the forest, 150 of which were used for interpolation of a salinity profile, and 50 of which were used for validation. They additionall collected species composition and forest structure data at &gt;500 plots of 15 x 15 m2 in the forest, and used these for accuracy assessment of the maps. The post-classifier was based on a Bayesian approach that employed probabilities of species given a pH level, and pH level given a species. Key results: Accuracy of the mangrove species map was improved significantly with the addition of the pH data. In particular: Overall accuracy was improved from 76.04 - 88.21% following inclusion of pH data Speckling within the original mangrove species map was greatly reduced following inclusion of the pH layer Confusion between R. mucronata and S. caseolaris persisted despite the inclusion of the pH data In reference to the results from Vaiphasa (2005), they found that the addition of the pH data was able to improve the separability of species within the Rhizophoraceae family (which exhibited high confusion following classification of hyperspectral data) The authors conclude that the method presented (classification followed by updating with ecological gradient data) may be an efficient means for producing detailed mangrove species maps in areas that are not too large (e.g., &lt; 100 km2). 5.2.10 Wang, 2009 “Distinguishing mangrove species with laboratory measurements of hyperspectral leaf reflectance” (Wang and Sousa 2009) Key contribution: Le and Wayne largely repeat the Vaiphasa, 2005 study (see Section 5.2.8) but for the three mangrove species common to central America. In addition, they examine the ability of hyperspectral data to estimate stress conditions in mangrove trees. Research design: They collected leaves from all three species in both stressed and unstressed conditions, and also collected leaves from the top and bottom portions of the canopy. They then subjected each of the leaves to hyperspectral measurements in a laboratory setting before analyzing the data. To reduce the feature space prior to spectral discrimination, they first used the ANOVA across all spectral bands to remove any bands that were non significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level (a la Vaiphasa, 2005). They then use Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) to examine for differences amongst the species. In addition, they use several indices of spectral bands identified by prior work as indices of leaf stress. Chlorophyl a and b contents drop dramatically in stressed leaves, greatly changing the reflectance properties of leaves. Studies have found that ratios are best in identifying stress characteristics, and they use these within ANOVA to compare means of ratios between stressed and unstressed leaves. Key results: The results generally find that hyperspectral data is effective in species discrimination and also identification of stressed mangrove trees. Some particularly key results are as follows: 116 of the 215 bands were significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level for distinguishing between species and were clustered in the 350-510 nm, 610-690 nm, 760-810 nm, 1370-1550 nm, and 1850-2500 nm ranges of the spectrum Red, white and black mangroves were capable of being discriminated using the hyperspectral data Use of the ratios for identifying stress in mangrove trees was effective, with different ratios performing better for different species (3/4 for red, 1/4 for white, and 4/4 for black) The specific band widths identified as significant in this study different from those of Vaiphasa, 2005 Key conclusions: Some key, broader-level conclusion from the study are as follows: Conventional challenges to analysing hyperspectral data are the large number of highly correlated bands available coupled with relatively smaller numbers of training and test samples. Wang and Sousa conclude that use of hyperspectral data is effective in overcoming the shortcomings of the multispectral datasets that they use in their 2004 sister studies. 5.2.11 Kamal, 2011 “Hyperspectral data for mangrove species mapping: A comparison of pixel-based and object-based approach” (Kamal and Phinn 2011) Key contribution: This study employs high resolution, hyperspectral data to map mangroves and wetland land classes at a landscape scale in Australia using three different methods. There are relevant points they make but the study feels somewhat lacking in general. Research design: CASI-2 hyperspectral data were used as the imagery (30 bands and 4 m spatial resolution) in this study. An existing digital map of mangrove species produced via photographic interpretation of aerial imagery, site data, and traverses was used for endmembers selection and accuracy assessments of the classifications. They use three different classification procedures to produce different maps of the landscape: Spectral angle mapper – uses a spectral library representative of different end members (i.e., the 9 targeted wetland classes) and assigns pixel to each based on a similarity measure Linear spectral unmixing – assumes each spectral signature is a linear combination of area weighted sum of reflectance of endmembers; total areas or pixels may then be assigned based on probabilistic basis Object-based mapping – used OBIA to segment the image before applying classification algorithms on the spectral signatures Key results: Of the three methods examined, OBIA performed the best (overall classification accuracy of 76%). Linear spectral unmixing produced the lowest overall classification accuracy. Conclusion: The classification accuracy is relatively lower than those found in other studies, and thus the results feel perhaps a bit short-sighted. Other metrics that could have been interesting to explore would have been texture given the high resolution nature of the dataset. Additionally, they do not dig into the hyperspectral bandwidths that are relevant, and thus there is valuable information that is missing from the study. Additionally, it is not entirely clear to me whether they used the coarse level reference map for their accuracy assessment, or whether field data was collected. If the reference map is of low-quality, their results are rather meaningless. 5.2.12 Dronova, 2012 “Landscape analysis of wetland plant functional types: The effects of image segmentation scale, vegetation classes and classification methods” (Dronova et al. 2012) Key contribution: This study examines the classification accuracy of plant functional types (PFTs) under different image segmentation scales and classification algorithms for Poyang Lake in China. The key results generally show that use of a coarser image scale (on average 5-8 Landsat pixels) significantly improved image classification of the different PFTs. Classification between the different algorithms were less significant. Research design: Field data for training and test validation were collected, and Landsat 5 TM data (bands 1-5 &amp; 7) were used for all image classification procedures. Image segmentation was performed at 9 different scales from (2 - 10), and six different classification algorithms were used: Bayesian Logistic Neural network Decision trees K-Nearest neighbors Support vector machines The image classification procedure was performed under two scenarios, the first being for generalized PFTs (3 classes), and the second being for specific PFTs (6 classes). Water, sand and other development were excluded prior to classification. Cluster analysis was performed on morphological and physiological data of the 51 species within the landscape to identify the different classes. Additionally, texture metrics within objects were computed and included in the classification procedure to examine their utility. Key results: The results found that OBIA generally improved the results of the classification for both the 3-class and 6-class sets Some specific results include: A scale of 8 was found to produce the highest classification accuracies for both classification sets (i.e., objects of 5-8 Landsat pixels) However, at the specific PFT level, the optimal scale parameter was found to be variable Texture metrics were not found to significantly improve classification accuracies, indicating that discrimination between the various classes was primarily spectrally based Overall classification accuracy was relatively similar for the different classification algorithms The authors conclude that smoothing of spectral signatures within objects lends to greater discrimination between PFTs, aiding in overall classification. Texture metrics may have proven to be insignificant in improving classification accuracies due to the relatively coarse nature of the Landsat data. Most other studies that have found texture to be significant have used high resolution imagery. Human interference and ecological conditions that produced mixed pixels resulted in reduced classification accuracy, and the authors conclude that mixed approaches (i.e., object-based followed by pixel-based, a la (Wang, Sousa, and Gong 2004)) may be an interesting means of resolving this issue. However, propagation of uncertainty has been under-explored and will be important in such scenarios. 5.2.13 Giri et al, 2014 “A study on abundance and distribution of mangrove species in Indian Sundarban using remote sensing technique” (Giri et al. 2014) References "],

The article primarily discusses: Defining biocomplexity Examining the characteristics of biocomplexity Speculating on the future of biocomplexity Biocomplexity - “properties emerging from the interplay of behavioral, biological, chemical, physical, and social interactions that affect, sustain, or are modified by living organisms, including humans,” as defined by (Michener et al. 2001) Key notes: Biocomplexity exists in contrast to the Popperian type of reductionalist science (causality &amp; falsification), and recognizes that reduced causal mechanisms often are not robust within real-world situations “myriad confounding factors operating at different temporal and spatial scales” Two features of “biocomplexity” biocomplexity occurs as temporal, spatial and conceptual boundaries are broken-down and worked across emergent &amp; unexpected properties may (or likely will) arise in response to biocomplexity Characteristics of “biocomplexity”: Relevant for a wide range of organisms; from microbial to megafauna (including humans) Relevant for a wide range of environments Reflected in nonlinear, chaotic, or unpredictable behaviors – which likely necessitates sophisticated and innovative quantitative procedures Likely to span many hierarchical levels as well as across multiples scales in time and space Key research trajectories for ecology (as posed by Thompson 2001): “Dynamics of coalescence in complex communities” - how do environmental constraints and species availability result in current complex ecological communities “Ecological memory” - how do past events &amp; conditions influence current ecological structure and conditions “Emergent properties” - examining whether the first principles of “hard” sciences can predict composition, structure &amp; function “Ecological topology” - identifying “rules” that occur over different scales of time and space, and examining how they interact to produce ecosystems Further reading: (Thompson et al. 2001) - Frontiers of ecology: As ecological research enters a new era of collaboration, integration, and technological sophistication, four frontiers (listed above) seem paramount for understanding how biological and physical processes interact over multiple spatial and temporal scales to shape the Earth’s biodiversity 6.1.2 Jones et al, 2006 “The new bioinformatics: Integrating ecological data from the gene to the biosphere” (Jones et al. 2006) Key contribution: This paper makes the case for “locating, accessing and integrating” data within ecology. They provide examples of the successes associated with doing so in alternative fields (genetics), and make a case for the need within ecology. They also outline vertically integrated databases (data warehouses) versus metadata-driven databases (data collections), and the relative pros/cons of the two. Examples of metadata and data collections in ecology: Key notes: Some relevant points from the article: A focus on “experimental” design and testing of multiple hypotheses makes ecological data inherently heterogeneous. Ecoinformatics importance is housed in ability to “allow a broader perspective over time and space, and across many disciplines, than is possible from on or a few studies,” and in allowing data to be reused for questions that may emerge in the future. Would appear to be well-suited to address questions of biocomplexity Current standard for storing of data is in heterogeneous spreadsheets Data warehouses (vertically-integrated) - databases that coalesce data from many investigators, but focus on one theme and are searchable often through an online interface Often represents a “least-common denominator” approach in that they are less complex than original dataset Examples: GenBank, VegBank or TreeBase Data collections (metadata-driven) - collection of datasets that are loosely structured together by well-crafted metadata. Some advantages are: Data of disparate types can be housed within a single location Focuses on project-level data and thus is familiar to researchers Metadata often more detailed Metadata often more precise and thus can be used in search functions Metadata standards - “consistent and rigorous sets of definitions for metadata categories that are broadly adopted by a research community.” Several examples exist within ecology: Ecological Metadata Language (EML) Biological Data Profile (BDP) Geographic Markup Language (GML) Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) - a metadata-drive repo that provides mappings from EML to BDP (but not from BDP to EML as of time of article publication) Data islands - data derived from researchers working on disparate, autonomous topics that focus on specific, predetermined hypotheses Often subject to entrenched domain-specific vocabularies and also assumptions; ontologies may be a way of resolving this limitation Ontologies - well-defined concepts or terms that have precise meanings within a specific domain or field, as well as formal mappings of how the terms interrelate Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge (SEEK) - one example of a system developing ontologies within ecology Further reading: Look into metadata languages (e.g., EML) Look into some of the earlier work on databases by Michener 6.1.3 Michener, 2006 “Meta-information concepts for ecological data management” (Michener 2006) Definitions: Metadata - information about data, i.e. higher level descriptions of data Meta-information - information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses; are these data products? Key contribution: Michener outlines some of the key criteria, challenges and opportunities for metadata within an ecological context. Notes on metadata: Some benefits of metadata include: Longevity of the data is greatly increased Reuse of the data both by the original researcher and others is facilitated Well-documented data may be used to expand scale of ecological inquiry The primary functionality of metadata is: Supports data discovery (most basic level) Facilitates the acquisition and use of data by humans (requires additional metadata) Enables automatic discovery, ingestion and analysis of data (requires more sophisticated metadata), which needs: research context (hypothesis, study site, experimental design, etc.) status of dataset physical structure of dataset info to facilitate use and comprehension Ecological Metadata Language (EML): EML is a standard for metadata that provides structure that supports automated functions of metadata listed above and is implemented in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Organized into modules, such as “dataset”, “access”, “physical”, “party coverage”, “project”, “methods”, “datatable”, “attribute”, and “physical” Additional info at ecoinformatics.org 6.1.4 Bekker et al, 2007 “Long term datasets: From descriptive to prescriptive data using ecoinformatics” (Bekker et al. 2007) Key contribution: This is the lead article to a special issue in Journal of Vegetation Science that focuses on ecoinformatics driven approaches to understanding complexity within vegetation systems. The article is less informative in its own right as much as a good pointer to other key studies working with vegetation science and ecoinformatics. It appears to be one of the earliest applications of ecoinformatics to vegetation science. Further reading: Le Duc, 2007 - A database application for long-term ecological field experiments Peacock, 2007 - The RAINFOR database, for monitoring forest biomass and dynamics 6.1.5 Hale &amp; Hollister, 2009 “Beyond data management: How ecoinformatics can benefit environmental monitoring programs” (Hale and Hollister 2009) Key contribution: This is a less seminal study. They describe the relevance of ecoinformatics for environmental monitoring, but do not go much beyond some of the other pieces on ecoinformatics and its relevance for ecology. Some relevant points that stood out to me: Standardization of taxonomic classes may be facilitated by ecoinformatics and application of ontologies in ecoinformatics Establishing standards and protocols can help in synthesizing studies and results across time and space Note: Likely better to focus on other studies within the literature than this one as they don’t bring up many points beyond those expressed in more seminal works. 6.1.6 Feller et al, 2010 “Biocomplexity in mangrove ecosystems” (Feller et al. 2010) Key contribution: Aim to elucidate the factors playing in at different hierarchical levels in mangrove ecosystems (biocomplexity). They use emergent properties (which they define as “patterns or processes that occur at multiple hierarchical levels within ecosystems”) to examine underlying ecological processes within mangroves. Biocomplexity appears to be thinking of ecology through a hierarchical lens, in which processes that exist at the “hard science” level (physics, chemistry, etc.) result in ecological processes &gt; functions &gt; services. Key findings: The article doesn’t differ much from other reviews of controls on mangrove processes, apart from the structure in which they examine: Controls of emergent properties (namely specializations for variable salinity, flooding and nutrient availability) e.g., salinity tolerance, flooding tolerance, reproductive traits/regeneration, nutrient availability perhaps analogous to “ecosystem processes” Collective properties of forests (e.g., zonation, productivity, nutrient cycling, food webs) perhaps analogous to “functions” Emergent/collective properties of ecosystems &amp; landscapes (e.g., habitat stability &amp; connectivity of ecosystems) perhaps analogous to “services” or “benefits” Emergent properties - concept that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts when examining ecological phenomena and the underlying processes that drive them. Emergent properties can exist at any scale, and may build upon themselves (e.g., morphology and physico-chemical conditions leading to ecophysiology (emergent property) which then leads to spatial assemblages (2nd emergent property), etc.). It may be helpful to think of different emergent properties at different scales of time and space. Three primary characteristics of emergent properties exist: Emergent properties are not simply the sum of their parts Emergent properties exist as a type that is different from their underlying components They cannot be easily predicted from individual components Examples of emergent properties within mangroves are ecophysiological traits (as listed above) that emerge from the interaction between biochemical and morphological traits with environmental factors. Individual Based Models (IBMs) are discussed as useful though limited tools for examining biocomplexity within mangroves, but note that there is relatively little work in this field to date. See section 3.1.10 for an example of using IBMs within mangroves. Relevance to research: Are IBMs relevant for research questions at hand? 6.1.7 Michener &amp; Jones, 2012 “Ecoinformatics: Supporting ecology as a data intensive science” (Michener and Jones 2012) Key contribution: This is a seminal study on the relevance of ecoinformatics written by two of the leading thinkers in the field. Key notes: Several key notes from the study are: The authors describe the “data life cycle,”&quot; with 8 steps that do not necessarily occur in sequential order and depend upon the analysis and research question at hand. The steps are: Plan - derive a data management plan that is often a living document as needs and uses for data will change over time Collect - there are highly variable mechanisms under which this occur given the vast amount of data types and collecting methods that exist; standardization in collection procedures is key for synthesizing data at later times Assure - measures taken to ensure data quality both before and after collection of the data; may consist of standardization of codes, units or metadata (e.g., using EML) Describe - sufficiently describing the data via metadata (who, what, when, where, why) Preserve - depositing of data in a repository such that they may be verified, maintained and accessed through time Discover - identifying appropriate data for research question of interest; double-edged sword in that you can get millions of hits or alternatively have tons of distinct data sources that exist only on disparate, local machines. DataONE is one such tool that drills down into data to identify datasets of actual interest; this is where ontologies come into play Integrate - understanding methodological differences, transforming to common representations and converting and recoding data to comparable semantics Analyze - reproducibility in analysis, with a particular focus on scientific workflows DataONE: DataONE is a research platform that seeks to support the entire data life cycle, as well as integrate many different forms of data. There are three principle components: Member Nodes - contribute data, computing resources and services (e.g., data repositories, universities, computing centers) Coordinating Nodes - support network-wide services such as indexing, replication, and interactability of Member Nodes Investigator Toolkit - tools for researchers to employ in all steps of the data life cycle Schematic of the data life cycle: 6.1.8 Soranno, 2014 “Cross-scale interactions: Quantifying multi-scaled cause – effect relationships in macrosystems” (Soranno et al. 2014) 6.1.9 Ruegg, 2014 “Completing the data life cycle: Using information management in macrosystems ecology research” (Rüegg et al. 2014) References "],
["ontologies.html", "6.2 Ontologies", " 6.2 Ontologies 6.2.1 Williams, 2006 “Ontologies for ecoinformatics” (Williams, Martinez, and Golbeck 2006) Key contribution: This is an early piece that gives an overview of what purpose ontologies may serve within ecology. They discuss it in particular relation to food webs within ecology, which are inherently complex with multiple definitions or system-specific interpretations for terms. Key notes: Ontologies should be employed to describe the following characteristics of a dataset: Where, when and by who the data are collected A description of what was observed, including identity and traits of the organism Sampling protocol, including collection procedures and associated experimental manipulations The architecture of the ontology can be designed intelligently such that the ontology is extensible, and allows for both system-specific interpretations as well as across-system relationships. For example, they discuss the importance of separating “entities” and “traits”. The piece by Madin, 2008 (see Section 6.2.3) provides a more comprehensive overview of ontologies within ecology and should be referred to in conjunction with this piece. 6.2.2 Madin, 2007 “An ontology for describing and synthesizing ecological observation data” (Madin et al. 2007) Key significance: Madin et al present a formal ontological framework within ecology (SEEK’s OBOE) that captures the essential semantic information of observational datasets, which will aid discovery and integration of data. The paper is structured: A discussion of ontologies and their relevance in ecology An introduction and overview of SEEK Extensible Observation Ontologies (OBOE) Several examples of use of OBOE for i) data discovery, ii) data summary, and iii) data integration **Notes:** Ontology - “A representation of the knowledge within a domain of interest, defined via the concepts within the domain as well as the properties and relationships among domain objects” The work of the authors of the study is founded within the SEEK project. SEEK aims to develop technology to discover, access, integrate and analyze distributed ecological information, primarily through extension of EML to support semantic annotation of ecological datasets. This is done primarily through OWL-DL (description logic) ontologies. Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) - aims to provide a core ontology framework for semantically annotating observational data sets. OBOE differs from other ecological ontologies in that it: Provides a robust framework for describing generic scientific observations Facilitates and structures the creation and sharing of domain-specific ontology extensions Provides discovery and integration services by semantic annotations to the ontology across variable domains of ecological observation data The core structure of OBOE is diagrammed below: The five key characteristics of OBOE are: Observations - formal statement that an entity of a particular type was observed Entities - all Observations are composed of exactly one Entity Measurements - Observations can be composed of Measurements, which represent measurable Characteristics of whatever entity is being observed Measurements are always associated with Observations Can have a variety of different characteristics, which are defined via the ofCharacteristic property Characteristics - “qualities” of the entity being observed Measurement standards - the units, scales, categories, catalogs and lists used when measuring characteristics. Two subclasses of Measurement standards exist: Entity naming standard - defines uniques names for unique identifies (e.g., “California”) Entity classification standard - entities associated with a classification have one or more instances (e.g., “red”, “5 m”) Additionally, for ratio or other complex units (e.g., ct / ha), the individual components may be assigned Measurement standards such that automatic conversions or data discovery may be performed. The different classes of the above can be used to describe the data, and facilitate machine-intelligent discovery, data summary and data integration. For example, data searches for density data may be able to identify datasets consisting of explicitly reported “density” data, as well as datasets that report the constituents of “density” (e.g., count &amp; area) 6.2.3 Madin, 2008 “Advancing ecological research with ontologies” (Madin et al. 2008) Key significance: This article gives an overview of ontologies in ecology, with particular focus on: What issue they are capable of resolving – i.e., integration of heterogeneous data What ontologies are and the forms they take Ongoing efforts to advance ontologies within ecology Ontologies provide a formal mechanism for defining terms and their relationships, and can improve the location, interpretation and integration of data based on its inherent meaning.&quot; The issue: Lack of critical consideration of “concepts” within ecology complicates interpretation and synthesis of findings, as well as the location and reuse of existing datasets. The solution: Ontologies provide a formal framework for establishing concepts within a discipline, and can resolve some of the issues that arise from multiple or nuanced interpretations of the same “concept” within ecology. Notes: Ontologies within ecology are becoming more common, with three particular trends emerging: Domain-specific ontologies that focus on capturing terminology used in specialized scientific disciplines or communities, for example: Ontologies in Web Ontology Language (OWL) for food-web networks that are described in Williams 2006 (see Section 6.2.1). Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) - Maintained by NASA JPL, use OWL ontologies to improve data integration and access capabilities. Framework ontologies that define general concepts and relationships that others can extend when building domain ontologies, for example: Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) - component of the SEEK project; basic concepts and relationships for describing observational datasets (e.g., field, experimental, simulation and monitoring data). Compatible with EML, and its core concepts (i.e., “Entity”, “Characteristic”, and “Measurement Standard”) can all be extended with domain-specific ontologies. Classes for Environmental Data Exchange (CEDEX) - formal framework for describing monitoring and experimental data from the European consortium of long-term ecological research stations. Observations Data Model (ODM) or the Open Geospatial Consortium’s Observations and Measurements model OGC O&amp;M - framework intended to facilitate the sharing and reuse of data within particular domains (hydrology projects for the first, geospatial work for the second); free-form extensibility of OBOE is not present. Other less formal approaches that identify and describe terms and concepts that are relevant to ecological research These commonly exist as thesauri that seek to standardize use of terms (and thus may aid in searching or browsing), but are not as effective as formal ontologies due to informal (and therefore a lack of logical relationships) nature. The authors provide a nice figure that exemplifies the architectural framework of responsible management and archiving of data: 6.2.4 Reichman, 2011 “Challenges and opportunities of open data in ecology” (Reichman, Jones, and Schildhauer 2011) Key significance: This piece focuses on how ecology (in some respects) has moved from a site-scale experimental field to one that is capable of large synthesis studies across broad spatial or temporal scales. They discuss issues of heterogeneity in data format and availability, and how to resolve them in order to perform synthetic analyses. Key notes: Reichman et al estimate that just 1% of ecological data that has been produced is available after publication of the associated results. They note three major technological challenges to “open data” (a la, Michiner, 2006), namely: Data dispersion - Decentralized existence across a broad range of databases (either local or online) Heterogeneity - Lack of consistency in collection, formatting and reporting Provenance - Issues of origin and history (relevant for datasets, as well as data products) Data dispersion: DataONE - A project designed to provide access to a number of central data repositories (e.g., Data Dryad) that facilitates data searching and access (also see Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)) Heterogeneity: Data heterogeneity unlikely to be resolved due to specific research objectives and logistical constraints. Use of structured metadata such as EML, however, is efficient at aiding access and reporting of heterogeneous data. Data provenance: Need scripted workflows that show quality control, processing and analysis of a dataset, particularly for derived datasets (e.g., meta-analyses or other secondary data objects) Unique identifiers (as DataONE) provides can be key for monitoring data provenance Social considerations: Social constraints to formalized sharing and archiving data are likely greater than the technical challenges. A formal reward system for promoting open access data may be key to advancing open data within ecology. 6.2.5 Wickham, 2014 “Tidy data” (Wickham and others 2014) Key significance: A formal description of Hadley’s “tidy data” concept. See also this online article, which is a bit more of a code-based explanation of tidy data. Key notes: Tidy data has the following fundamental format: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. Data tidying - as organizing datasets such to facilitate analysis In organizing data, there is a general rule of thumb that it’s easier to describe functional relationships between variables (i.e., linear combinations of columns) rather than relationships between observations (rows); AND it’s easier to compare across groups of observations (rows) relative to between groups of variables (columns) There are four basic verbs for data manipulation: Filter - subsetting or removing observations based on a condition Transform - adding or modifying variables Aggregate - collapsing multiple values into a single value Sort - changing the order of observations Tidy data is particularly useful for modeling, and is a large part of why it is designed/promoted.

The crux of the idea here is that mangrove geomorphology in an applied sense exists largely through nominal definitions, when in actuality there is high heterogeneity within many of the various classes. I will review the literature surrounding mangrove geomorphology from a historical perspective, identify key factors to be quantified or monitored, and look at potential remote sensing applications that exist today, or will be coming online in the next 5 to 10 years.

MDP Research questions: What are the existing applications of remote sensing data to hydrology and sedimentary processes in mangrove ecosystems to date? Given new RS data types and their applications in fields outside of mangrove ecology, what opportunities for mapping and better-understanding mangrove geomorphology exist? Given new RS data types and their applications…, what challenges for mapping and better-understanding mangrove geomorphology exist? Abstract: For mangrove restoration and conservation projects, it is critical to understand the relationships between mangrove tree species and the geomorphological conditions in which they exist, as well as how they vary over time. While remote sensing of mangrove vegetation is commonplace within the academic literature, fewer studies employ remote sensing to study mangrove geomorphology. The use of remote sensing offers a valuable means to understand mangrove geomorphology at various temporal and spatial scales, as field studies of mangrove hydrology and sedimentary processes are complex and difficult. Given the rapid development of remote sensing technology, a thorough examination of the existing techniques and best practices for better understanding mangrove geomorphology is warranted. Thus, we present here a review of remote sensing of geomorphological processes in mangroves. Our review shows that use of remote sensing to monitor mangrove geomorphology has largely been limited to studies of shoreline erosion and progradation over the past few decades. Increasingly available new data sources such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral datasets, however, are providing access to novel and informative data layers, such as topography at fine resolutions and total suspended sediment. Leveraging future advances in remote sensing to better monitor mangrove geomorphology will be important for conserving these ecosystems, particularly given increasing global pressures from coastal development and sea level rise.

I currently envisage this as testing for correlations between soil organic carbon stocks and forest biomass, structure, and species composition properties. I am working on building a database for mangroves of the Americas with a URAP student that parallels the one I built for Southeast Asia during my master’s work, and am interested in testing the same models on the new dataset. I am also considering getting another URAP student to begin compiling a database for Africa / the middle East, which is the other major region for mangroves. One valuable product would be a comprehensive database of mangrove forest structure and soil characteristics data, with checks on how comparable the different sampling methodologies, datasets, etc. are.

Note: If I am successful in constructing a database of forest structure, species, etc. from the literature, there are many other research questions that can be explored, such as: Examining effects of sea level rise or tidal range on mangrove structure &amp; species assemblages.

["zonation.html", "3.1 Zonation &amp; disturbance", " 3.1 Zonation &amp; disturbance 3.1.1 Preface Establishment of monospecific stands of mangrove trees in zones parallel to shorelines (zonation) has been among the most well-studied phenomenon in mangroves. Several hypotheses attempting to explain zonation in mangroves have existed throughout time, each of which has been supported to varying degrees within the literature: Zonation as mangrove succession due to land building - Davis, 1940: From his work in Florida, Davis believed that mangroves promoted shoreline progradation, which was followed by establishment of Avicennia germinans species in the most seaward portion of the intertidal zone. Eventually Rhizophora mangle with a few Laguncularia racemosa individuals would outcompete A. germinans as the shore (and thus habitat for A. germinans) continued to prograde. Davis believed that the zones of species were a successional process, eventually climaxing in a terrestrial forest dominated by non-mangrove species. [Not supported] Zonation as response to geomorphic condition - Thom, 1967: Thom did his field work in a composite lagoon and riverine system in Tabasco, Mexico, and provided one of the first most comprehensive sets of evidence against Davis’s hypothesis of zonation as mangrove succession. In looking at the different habitats in which mangrove tree species existed, Thom concluded that zonation of species was in response to the hydrological and substratum conditions of a site, which were ultimately variables controlled by geomorphic processes. As a result, he concluded that spatial patterns of mangrove species were in response to geomorphic changes in the land rather than mangrove species inducing patterns in geomorphology (and thus species zonation was relatively “stable”). [Supported] Zonation as adaptation to physico-chemical gradients - Watson, 1928; Davis, 1940; Macnae, 1968; Ball 1988: One of the more commonly examined hypotheses for examining species zonation and investigated by a wide range of researchers. Watson’s “inundation classes” and discussion of salinity may be one of the earliest, well-cited references to environmental gradients. The hypothesis holds that mangrove species have adapted to establish or compete in microenvironments that exist along environmental gradients. Given the dynamic nature of mangrove ecosystems, it is unlikely that mangrove species specialize to unique microenvironments, but more likely exhibit tolerance to a wide range of conditions. However, some may preferentially outcompete others in environments towards the ends of gradient spectrums, and thus ecophysiology may play an important role in competition and survival or growth following establishment. [Supported, for particular considerations] Zonation as result of interspecific competition - Clarke and Hannon, 1970: Zonation due to tidal sorting of propagules - Rabinowitz, 1978: Upon investigating no significant difference in survival and growth rates of Avicennia, Rhizophora, Laguncularia, and Pelliciera tree individuals planted in monospecific stands in Panama, Rabinowitz concluded that mangrove zonation is not primarily controlled by physiological variables. In response, she hypothesized that the zonation of species may be due to differences in propagule size and weight between species. The hypothesis posits that differences in size and weight have enabled species to establish in areas with different tidal regimes (smaller propagules in shoreward zones, larger propagules in landward zones). Rabinowitz provides a discussion of the hypothesis and identifies several other studies that may support the hypothesis. [Partially supported - directionality NOT supported whereas tidal depth supported] Zonation as result of differential predation on propagules - Smith, 1987: (Smith 1987) was among the first studies to experimentally test the existence of differential rates of propagule predation by grapsid crabs for different mangrove tree species. His results showed that differential rates of mangrove predation did exist for the distinct species, and were correlated to the nutritional content (e.g., presence of tannins, simple sugars, etc.) of the species. Furthermore, he found a significant negative relationship between species dominance and rate of propagule predation, which led him to conclude that differential rates of propagule predation influence the zonation of species in mangroves. Perhaps most clearly, he found that A. marina was consumed heavily within the mid-intertidal region of the forest, in which no parent trees of A. marina exist. Smith notes that no single hypothesis is likely to explain all of zonation, but that the results of his study are significant and parallel those of other studies in terrestrial forests. [Partially supported] Several comprehensive reviews of zonation in mangroves are provided in: Lugo and Snedaker, 1974 (Reviewed in Section 3.1.3) Smith, 1992 (Reviewed in Section 3.1.8) 3.1.2 Thom, 1967 “Mangrove ecology and deltaic geomorphology: Tabasco, Mexico” (Thom 1967) Key contribution: Thom’s work in the lagoons and riverine settings (“composite river &amp; wave-dominated”) of Tabasco, Mexico was one of the most well-cited examples against Thom’s hypothesis of mangrove succession. In looking at the different hydrological regimes and substratum of various mangrove “zones,” he concluded that mangrove zonation in species was in response to geomorphic condition and was relatively stable in time (as opposed to altering landscapes and facilitating succession). Thom generally concluded that mangroves were opportunistic in their establishment, but particular species do have the capabilities to affect the rates at which geomorphic processes occur such as prop roots of Rhizophora spps. choking tidal channels. The following chart details the presence of different stand types within the geomorphic settings of Tabasco, Mexico. Key findings: Thom’s findings provided evidence that: Mangroves establish in areas of naturally accreting soil, but facilitate accretion of soil upon establishment (e.g., Rhizophora choking creeks &amp; channels). Mangroves are opportunistic in their establishment, largely responding to geomorphic conditions Thom went on to provide a series of geomorphic clastic and carbonate settings in which mangroves “generally” exist Further reading: Thom 1982 - Identification of five geomorphic clastic settings Thom 1984 - Identification of three geomorphic carbonate settings 3.1.3 Lugo &amp; Snedaker, 1974 “The ecology of mangroves” (Lugo and Snedaker 1974) Key contribution: Lugo and Snedaker’s seminal work on the ecology of mangroves (in Florida) is most commonly cited for their definition of six mangrove forest types: Fringe forest - Mangrove assemblages that are found on the fringes of sheltered coastlines. Zonation in species typically follows Davis’s patterns. Riverine forest - Tall forests found in floodplains and along riverine systems of deltas and estuaries. These may occur in conjunction with “fringe forests,” are tidally flushed, yet have more complex hydrological influences from upland, freshwater sources. Overwash forest - Forest types often consisting of Rhizophora species over low islands or small projections in bays and estuaries that are only inundated with high tides. Basin forest - Mangrove assemblages that occur in the “basins” in between tidal channels and distributaries, or behind the levees of rivers and channels. Often among the most extensive sections of mangrove forests and may exhibit zonation with changes in elevation as the landward zone of the forest is reached. Hammock forest - A variant of the basin forest occuring in fringe forests in areas of raised topography. Dwarf forest - Mangrove forests that occur along flat coastal fringes and are stunted in growth (height) due to nutrient limitations. In addition, Lugo and Snedaker provide a review of matter cycling in mangroves; however, more recent reviews of the topic have been written and should be referred to. Lugo and Snedaker provide a conceptual model of energy flows in mangroves that should be reviewed: 3.1.4 Rabinowitz, 1978a “Dispersal properties of mangrove propagules” (Rabinowitz 1978a) Key contribution: This paper provides a review of propagule physiology and establishment for six species from Panama (L. racemosa, A. germinans, A. bicolor, R. mangle, R. harisonii, and P. rhizophorae). Rabinowitz reviews the different anatomy and physiology of the four genera, and then provides results from experiments on dispersal characteristics such as time of floatation, time to rotting and time to establishment. Key knowledge: Mangroves are viviparous in that propagules go from parent tree to embryonic stage to establishment continuously without a “dormant” period. Propagules often sprout roots during the dispersal stage, which aids in their establishment. Key finding: After her experiments, Rabinowitz found that smaller propagules from Avicennia and Laguncularia were less capable of sinking or establishing underwater, and thus are more likely to be limited to higher areas with periodic absences of tidal inundation (where they are characteristically found). The larger propagules of Rhizophora and Pelliciera are capable of sinking and establishing underwater, and thus are not limited in areas of establishment. 3.1.5 Rabinowitz, 1978b “Early growth of mangrove seedlings in Panama, and an hypothesis concerning the relationship of dispersal and zonation” (Rabinowitz 1978b) Study design: Examined growth and survival of R. harisonii. A. sps, L. racemosa, and P. rhizophorae in each of four monospecific parent swamps in different locations of Panama (i.e., four parent stands at each of four sites). Gardens of each of the four species were planted and examined for growth and survival to see if seedlings fared better in stands of their parent species. Key findings: Rabinowitz examined establishment of four different genera (Avicennia, Laguncularia, Pelliciera, and Rhizphora) in stands of both their parent genus as well as others. Her findings were primarily: seedlings generally grew better in habitats of other mangroves than in own parents habitat growth of seedling largely equal across parents swamps superior growth (when present) typically seen in foreign swamp no habitat with greater growth across all mangroves Thus, Rabinowitz found little evidence of the hypothesis that physiological conditions along a tidal gradient control mangrove zonation. The graph below shows survival of seedings of the four genera in the four different parent habitats. Key contribution: In response to her findings, Rabinowitz provides the “tidal sorting” hypothesis, which posits that “mangrove zonation may be controlled by tidal sorting of propagules according to size and by differential ability of propagules to establish in deep water.” She provides a discussion of the hypothesis as well as links it to several studies in the academic literature which support the notion. Key limitations: The key limitations of the study is the length of the work (just one year), as well as consideration of only seedlings rather than saplings and seedlings. Ecophysiological controls on survival rates may not occur until later in time (in which competitive influences are stronger), and thus the conclusion that Rabinowitz gives may have been premature (see (McKee 1995)). Further reading: Rabinowitz, 1978 - “Dispersal properties of mangrove propagules” Sousa et al, 2007 3.1.6 Ball, 1980 “Patterns of secondary succession in a mangrove forests of Southern Florida” (Ball 1980) Key contribution: This study examines secondary succession in Biscayne Bay, FL and attributes differences in species composition within the two dominant forest stands (below and above mean tidal reach) as a result of competition between R. mangle and L. racemosa. Study design: The authors coupled study of aerial photography of the region with field based surveys of the relative importance of seedlings, saplings, and live and dead trees within: A “historical”&quot; forest stand Three induced forest stands Key results: Their result found that R. mangle was dominant in stands below mean tidal range, whereas L. racemosa was dominant (though sparse and stunted) in areas upland of the mean tidal range. Ball concludes that the spatial patterning is a result of competitive dominance of R. mangle in the low intertidal, given that seedlings and saplings of both R. mangle and L. racemosa are both present in the stand. Ball hypothesizes that both species likely established at an early time, and L. racemosa was able to establish due to shade intolerance and faster growth rates. As presence of R. mangle has increased and overtopped L. racemosa, a shift in community composition is occurring. 3.1.7 Putz &amp; Chan, 1986 “Tree growth dynamics and productivity in a mature mangrove forest in Malaysia” (Putz and Chan 1986) Key contribution: This study describes mangrove development and growth dynamics in a protected forest in Matang, Malaysia over the course of 60 years. The research represents one of the few studies done on mangroves over many decades, as disturbance regimes often prevent long-term succession as well as a lack of research interest. Key findings: Several key findings in long-term mangrove development were identified: R. apiculata slowly decreased in forest dominance relative to B. gymnorrhiza and B. parviflora. Bruguiera species are more shade-tolerant and may represent a more traditionally “climax” class of mangrove species. Gap openings were largely caused by termites and fungus killing trees, which would fall against neighboring trees, damage roots and bark and allow termites to transfer trees. Putz and Chan describe the disturbance dynamics as “domino-like,” but also note it is unlikley to be “normal” disturbance dynamics. Based on growth-rates and age-class distributions, Putz and Chan conclude that self-thinning did occur within the forest, particularly for R. apiculata. Total biomass was relatively high, with “stable” biomass estimated at 350-400 Mg/Ha. 3.1.8 Smith, 1992 “Forest structure” (In Robertson and Alongi, 2002) (Smith 1992) Overview: This chapter (from Robertson and Alongi, 2002) gives a broad overview of mangrove forest structure with a particular emphasis on zonation in species. Smith describes factors that influence species composition, the patterns of species assemblages across the intertidal zone, and physical forest structure attributes such as height or stem density. Key knowledge: Mangroves lack understory vegetation commonly found within terrestrial tropical forests Species zonation patterns differ between “Old World” and “New World” tropics (???) primary zonation hypotheses: land building &amp; succession geomorphology response to physico-chemical gradients tidal sorting hypothesis differential predation interspecific competition Many mangroves have even-aged size-class structure Stand height, density and biomass accumulation seem to correlate with climatic factors, particularly rainfall Mangroves appear to have more pioneer-phase traits (e.g., r-strategy dispersal of propagules) relative to mature-phase traits - which may support Thom, 1967’s hypothesis of “opportunistic” establishment. Status of zonation hypotheses as of 1992: Further reading: Chapman 1976 - Extensive review of early literature surrounding mangrove zonation 3.1.9 Bunt, 1996 “Mangrove zonation: An examination of data from seventeen riverine estuaries in tropical Australia” (Bunt 1996) Key significance: This study compiles species occurrence data from 17 rivers in northern Australia to test hypotheses of zonation. This study is a precursor to Ellison 2000 (see Section 3.1.11), and employs an attempt at quantitatively assessing zonation in mangroves. Study design: They use a methodology developed by Williams et al 1991 that scores species distributions between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating presence at the water edge and 1 indicating presence in the landward limit of the mangrove. In addition, a standard deviation is calculated which is a measure of how widely it is distributed across the transect with respect to its most probably location. Transects were laid normal to the water at three different locations along each river (downstream, midstream and upstream) and were extended until the landward limit of the mangrove forest. Key results: The study results show that species-specific patterns of zonation across the various rivers do not exist. Although some zonation trends appear across transects within rivers, the dataset as a whole is highly variable. In particular, the centers of distribution are not consistent from river to river, and furthermore orderings are not consistent even within transects along a river. Bunt attributes the variation in distribution of species to abiotic and biotic controls that vary largely at fine scales. For future investigations of spatial distributions of mangroves, they recommend a site-specific approach as regional trends are unlikely to exist. 3.1.10 Chen &amp; Twilley, 1998 “A gap dynamic model of mangrove forest development along gradients of soil salinity and nutrient resources” (Chen and Twilley 1998) Key contribution: This study employs a FORMAN model to examine forest development and succession in South Florida across nutrient gradients. The study is novel in that it employs an individual-tree based model to examine different effects of recruitment, nutrient availability, and response to disasters (hurricanes) for R. mangle, A. germinans and L. racemosa. Key findings: The study primarily examines i) species dominance (as measured by BA) in response to salinity and nutrient response surfaces, ii) regeneration following disturbance, and iii) long-term mangrove succession (500 yrs). Key findings from each of the three model explorations are detailed below: nutrient gradients - BA didn’t increase linearly with increasing soil fertility, indicating that light or competition influence forest development; patterns of forest development varied depending on time scales (35 vs. 100 vs. 300 years). At 100-year time frame, patterns in species partitioning along resource gradients was observed. disturbance - equal sapling recruitment scenarios for all three species overestimated total basal area, which is indicative that recruitment rates are not equal amongst species; succession - long-term succession was found to be sensitive to recruitment rates for each species. The degree of shade tolerance/intolerance of the different species was concluded to be significant in long-term succession dynamics. Research relevance: Can the same models be employed to look at shifts in forest structure due to sea-level rise? 3.1.11 Ellison, 2000 “Testing patterns of zonation in mangroves: Scale dependence and environmental correlates in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh” (Ellison, Mukherjee, and Karim 2000) Key contribution: This is one of the first statistically rigid accounts of testing zonation in mangroves. The authors employ a variety of statistical techniques to test the hypothesis that mangrove species correlate with surface elevation (i.e., tidal zone) and edaphic characteristics in mangroves. Study design: Eleven blocks with three transects 200 m in length (20 adjacent 10 x 10 m plots) running from the shoreward to landward sections of the forest were established in the Sundarbans. Density, frequency and basal area were measured for all species within each plot, as well as edaphic characteristics such as salinity, field capacity (moisture), CEC, soil texture, and nutrient availability. The data were tested across different scales (within transect, within block, across blocks) to test for mangrove zonation at different scales. Key results: The results did not find any evidence of statistically robust zonation at any of the scales tested. Canonical correspondence analysis did show low amounts of variation in species composition explained by edaphic conditions (24%), but relationships were unclear for the majority of the species that dominate the forest. The authors conclude that patterns of mangroves are likely more complex than is generally thought in the literature, and may be due to complex interactions between edaphic conditions across space as well as species-specific adaptation to those specific conditions. Additionally, they suggest that interspecific competition or propagule dispersal may be important in determining size and abundance of co-occuring species. The results of the study match those of others that have attempted to explain zonation patterns through statistical tests (see Section 3.1.9. 3.1.12 Sherman et al, 2000 “Small-scale disturbance and regeneration dynamics in a neotropical mangrove forest” (Sherman, Fahey, and Battles 2000) Key contribution: Sherman et al describe chracteristics of gap creation and closure through time and gap regeneration dynamics in the Dominican Republic. The primary intermediate disturbance at their site is lightning-induced gaps, with the forest regenerating from a large tidal wave several decades prior. Their evidence does not support the hypothesis that zonation in mangrove species is reinforced by gap regeneration, with R. mangle dominating gap regeneration in all three zone types. Key findings: The following key findings are provided by the study: Hypothesis that species zonation is reinforced by gap dynamics was not supported by evidence R. mangle dominated gap regeneration, not due to increased density of seedlings (found to be highly variable with patterns emerging depending on dominant species zone), but due to higher survivorship in standing water; seedling &amp; sapling growth found to be significantly greater in gaps than forest Gaps were characterized by a collapse of the peat-mat and thus regions of standing water Found that seedling and sapling density generally followed mature tree (by basal area) compositions for both transects Current spatial distribution of species zones is still unexplained for the site NOTE Need to go back and figure out how long this study was performed for! 3.1.13 Sousa et al, 2007 “Supply-side ecology in mangroves: Do propagule dispersal and seedling establishment explain forest structure?” (Sousa et al. 2007) Supply-side ecology: “hypothesis of community structure being influenced more heavily by supply of new individuals to a site rather than post-recruitment biotic interactions (Roughgarden by Lewin [1986])” Tidal sorting hypothesis: TSH has multiple components: Dispersal of mangrove propagules is controlled primarily by their shape and size Establishment of mangrove propagules is differentiated by size and depth of tidal waters Key contribution: Sousa et al provides one of the few empirical tests of the TSH. Their results by and large do not strictly support all components of the TSH: Direction (NOT SUPPORTED) - all propagules dispersed seawards, regardless of size Distance (SUPPORTED) - Laguncularia propagules travelled much further than Rhizophora or Avicennia trapping of seedlings behind logs or other barriers contributes to patchy establishment Establishment (SUPPORTED) - only Rhizophora established in the pen at the lowest tidal elevation, which is indicative that larger heavier propagules are better able to establish in deeper water (as TSH predicts) Key findings: Directional flow of rainfall runoff overwhelms tidal flows and causes all propagules to disperse in a seawards direction Rhizophora seedlings moved very short distances, indicating that their commonly-believed widespread dispersal via marine systems may be misrepresentative of average dispersal mechanisms, particularly within mature forests. The TSH does not sufficiently explain zonation at the Punta de Galeta. Sousa et al provide two alternative hypotheses for zonation TSH may function strictly during periods of tidal storm surge, when smaller propagules are carried much further inland Zonation may be a result of historical patterns of biogeography as the three species appeared in the region at different times In addition, the authors provide three key criticisms of Rabinowitz’s TSH: Her early studies of species survival and growth in stands of different parent organisms only lasted for a year, and thus physico-chemical factors may not have had time to influence survival given large nutrient reserves. Other studies, however, have since supported Rabinowitz’s findings and provide evidence against the physico-chemical hypothesis of zonation The patterns of zonation predicted by the TSH do not always occur in mangroves; their are examples of forests where the species patterning is different or even opposite from what is predicted. The pattern of disperal predicted by TSH does not hold in all cases; Sousa et al found that dispersal direction was actually opposite of what was predicted by TSH.

["ecophysiology-establishment.html", "3.2 Ecophysiology &amp; establishment", " 3.2 Ecophysiology &amp; establishment 3.2.1 Chapman, 1976, Ch. 8 “Ch. 8 - Ecological factors” (Chapman 1976a) Key contribution: This is a somewhat dated review of ecological factors that are influential on mangrove vegetation. There are more recent reviews that should be referred to, but this chapter provides a nice overview of some of the earlier work related to mangrove vegetation and ecological factors. Key notes: Inundation - The effects of salinity versus frequency and duration of inundation likely influences seedlings versus mature trees differentially. Inundation “classes” were originally proposed by Watson (and others), but likely have little practical value now. Number of days of lack of inundation is understood (by Chapman) to be the most important component of “inundation” more broadly. There is a seasonal component that is important to consider (i.e., areas that have no tidal inundation and no rainfall may be more hypersaline and hostile to establishment). Salinity - Chapman notes that there are correlations between salinity and presence of vegetation, but the relationships may be overstated. Soil composition - The texture of soils is extremely important as it relates to drainage and also aeration of the soil. The presence of sand within the soil can be extremely important; often have complete lack of oxygen within 5 cm soil depth (along channels as well). Presence of peat or other organic layers can greatly influence gas and water infiltration. The dark color of soils is related to iron sulfide production by anaerobic bacteria. Water table and drainage - The mean level of the water table has been found at some sites to increase as you move towards the shoreward section of the forest. There is very little movement with seasonal changes in tide (i.e., spring vs. neap tides), which may be related to the texture of the soil present. Some carbonate settings have extremely coarse substrates (majority of sand &gt; 2 mm). non NaCl soil chemistry - CEC is generally higher in the surface levels of the soil. Biota: Chapman provides 6 habitats in which biota exist, as an extension of MacNae. They most significant habitat for my particular research purposes are the ecosystem engineers, which would consist of the crustaceans that inhabit the canopies, the soil surface, and the soil itself. Further reading: Need to look up sulfur reduction processes. 3.2.2 Chapman, 1976, Ch. 9 “Ch. 9 - Physiology of mangroves” (Chapman 1976b) Physiology - Functioning Key contribution: This chapter provides a nice overview of the physiology of mangroves, primarily in relation to: Physiology of viviparous seedlings Physiology of the pneumatophores Physiology of salt control Osmotic pressures Transpiration rates Carbon assimilation rates Viviparous seedlings - The salinity of seedlings has been shown to be much lower than that of parent trees. This might increase buoyancy of the propagule and also protect it against very hostile environments. Seedlings quickly take up salts upon establishment, rapidly reaching to osmotic potentials of parent trees. Additionally, seedlings are found to be able to respire anaerobically. Respiration may be inhibited by several factors, such as presence of a fruit wall (A. marina) or the uptake of large concentrations of salts (R. mucronata). Pneumatophores - A number of studies have shown that pneumatophores are largely plant systems responsible for exchanges of gases. The discussion of pneumatophores here focused on three primary points: Gaseous exchange - Much of this is conducted through the lenticels, which may also occur on stilt roots. The individual pneumatophores are seen as being responsible for aerating the particular section of cable root it exists upon, as well as any stabilizing roots underneath. Respiratory function - Respiratory activity of pneumatophores likely makes up a significant (1/8 to 1/2) of total respiration. Other purposes - Pneumatophores may server other purposes besides gas exchange or respiration. For example: Sonneratia and Avicennia pneumatophores produce very fine roots near the surface of the soil which aid in absorbing nutrients. As sediment accretes, the lower rootlets cease functioning and new sets closer to the surface are produced. Older pneumatophores may exist primarily as support organs for the absorbing rootlets This is interesting in reference to carbon, soil accretion and biological contribution; it would be good to look into morphological differences of roots in mangroves. A review article? Salt control - Different strategies exist to deal with maintaining osmotic potentials and handling salts within mangroves. Salt exuding - Avicennia and Aegiceras spps. are able to exude salt from glands in leaves, which is an energy intensive process. These same species do not appear to exclude salt at the roots to the same degree that other species without salt secretion glands do. Exclusion at roots - Species without salt secretion glands maintain high osmotic potentials within their roots, which prevents much of the salt in the root system from entering the tree. Increasing leaf succulence - Differential rates of storage of water and salts in vacuoles and leaf tissues vary amongst species, as well as with tree age and also environmental salinity levels. The coupling of root exclusion and increasing leaf succulence may be primary mechanisms of handling salinity for non-secreting species. Osmotic pressures - Osmotic pressure is the tendency for water to enter a solution through osmosis. High OPs indicate a higher ability to take in water via osmosis. Interestingly, the OP in excess of sea water (i.e., effective OP) in mangroves is comparable to OP values in terrestrial species. When considering OP in mangroves, need to think of three compartments: OP in roots - uptake of water OP in leaves - transpiration and thus loss of water OP in vascular stem - flow rates within the plant For non salt-secreting species, the flow of water through the system is largely salt-free. OPs can vary within species depending on different salinity conditions, which might be reflected in succulence or other traits measurable by remotely sensed data (hyperspectral imagery). Transpiration rates - The transpiration rates of mangroves are reduced in saline conditions, and are affected by other environmental factors such as soil texture (e.g., more rapid transpiration from plants in sand than mud), but also depends on species. Evidence has been shown that transpiration rates are higher for Avicennia in presence of salt. Some researchers have considered mangroves as xerophytic systems (i.e., arid systems with lack of water), but others have attacked this in that mangroves receive continuous supply of water (though limited) and thus are not living in a water limited system. For non-mangrove species living in a mangrove ecosystem, xerophytic conditions are likely present. Carbon assimilation - The information provided here is cursory and simply points to a lack of information. Marilyn Ball has done much more work on this topic, particularly in relation to PWUE, and her articles should be referred to here. 3.2.3 Ball, 1988 “Ecophysiology of mangroves” (Ball 1988) Key significance: This is an excellent review of the ecophysiology (how the phyisology of the trees responds to their particular environment) of mangrove trees. This paper should be reviewed more than once. One of the key concepts to emerge from this study is: Mangroves have largely evolved to have large tolerances to salinity and inundation given the very dynamic environments in which they exist. Rather than evolving to exist in narrow niches, competition may drive zonation and thus the existence of multiple species in moderate stress environments. Key notes: Waterlogging - Key fact is that oxygen diffuses through air 10,000 times more rapidly than through water, thus root systems of mangroves are adapted such that they avoid extensive inundation through areal roots. degree of soil saturation effects form and availability of different nutrients – how specifically does this happen? may have different amounts of availability of P and N along the tidal gradient N primarily exists as ammonia in frequently tidal regions, which binds easily to organic compounds and thus persists within the soil system N exists primarily as nitrate in less frequently flooded zones, which is more prone to leaching. Typically find that these zones are P limited rather than N limited, however, which is easily absorped onto clay or precipitated with Ca, Al, or Fe Salinity - Important to remember that tolerance of salinity is largely dependent upon the developmental stage of the plant! The presence of cotyledonary reserves allow seedlings to persist in conditions that are otherwise inhospitable to them, but may not establish successfully following depletion of these reserves. Mangroves frequently classified according to three different mechanisms of tolerance: salt exclusion - all mangroves exclude salt at the root tips salt accumulation - all mangroves accumulate ions (though they show preferential differences for different ions) to maintain osmoregulation salt excretion - selective species have ability to excrete salts The particular salinity tolerance of a species may be particularly difficult to determine due to the species deriving water from sources other than surface water (i.e., freshwater underground seepage). Compartmentalization of ions is extremely important for maintaining biochemical processes, for example photosynthesis, especially for those species that are incapable of secreting salts. The ratio of Na+ / K+ is important in chloroplasts (cell of the leaf responsible for photosynthesis). Deficiencies in K+ concentration have been shown to result in loss of photosynthetic capability, particularly for Avicennia species. The major mechanism of ion transport into the transpiration system of the plant is through symplastic pathways (inside of plasma membrane where water and low-molecular-weight solutes can diffuse freely). Species of some genera (Acanthus, Aegialitis, Aegiceras and Avicennia) are capable of secreting salt from leaves. Photosynthesis - Most evidence points towards C3 photosynthetic pathways within mangrove species, however they exhibit very conservative water-use efficiencies relative to most C3 plants. Mangroves exhibit a variety of traits/mechanisms to manage water use efficiency while maintaining carbon assimilation. Three major leaf characteristics for maintaining leaf temperatures that vary among species are: leaf angle - affects radiant heat loading on the leaf and can be adjusted to reduce solar incidence leaf size - heat transfer is a function of the leaf geometry and wind speed; decreases in leaf size allows the leaf to maintain temperatures close to ambient temperatures, with sacrificing solar incidence heat capacity per unit area - a function of dry weight and water content per unit area; higher heat capacity buffers against warming of leaves A classic, hypothetical schematic of interspecific tolerances for salinity is shown below: Major tradeoffs - The two major tradeoffs that are seen in mangroves in relation to photosynthesis and salinity tolerances are: Salt exclusion during water uptake may induce significant carbon costs to the plant; often seen through more root biomass coupled with decrease in rate of water uptake High water use efficiency restricts rates of water efflux but also restricts rates of CO2 influx Relevant for research: differential amounts of root biomass may be seen along salinity gradients due to differing degrees of water use efficiency and maintenance of photosynthetic production - what are the implications for soil C? 3.2.4 McKee, 1993 “Soil physicochemical patterns and mangrove species distribution - reciprocal effects?” (McKee 1993) Key contribution: Methods: The study employed field and greenhouse analyses to examine the impacts of reducing soil conditions and sulphide presence on seedling growth. Field work was performed in Florida, with common zonation of R. mangle in the fringe forest and mixes of R. mangle and A. germinans in the basin forest that filters out to monospecific stands of A. germinans in the most landward basin. Soil samples were collected along transects directly next to Rhizophora prop roots, Avicennia pneumatophores, a mix of the two roots, as well as no roots for comparison of reducing soil conditions and sulphides. A factorial treatment arrangement for four flooding conditions on two species was designed in a greenhouse experimental setting to examine the effects of reducing conditions and sulfide on seedling growth, and vice versa. Key results: Field studies - Distinct zonation between both species composition and reducing soil conditions and sulphide were seen. Changes in Eh and sulphide concentration strongly correlated with shifts in species compositions. Higher Eh was found for mixed basin and fringe forest, whereas lower Eh was found with monospecific-basin Avicennia Higher sulphide concentrations were found in monospecific basin A. germinans region (contrasts with results of seedlings study). Greenhouse studies - Greatest difference in biomass growth between flooding treatments was seen belowground. A. germinans exhibited much lower growth in the flooded treatments relative to the drained treatment, whereas flooding stimulated belowground growth in R. mangle. Presence of sulphide had little effect on growth (AG or BG) of R. mangle, but was found to reduce AG and BG growth in A. germinans. Additionally, the presence of both species induced higher redox potential (Eh) relative to soils without any mangrove seedilings. Addition of sulphide induced a reduction in Eh. - This is likely due to O2 leaking from mangrove roots into the rhizosphere and thus inducing higher redox potentials - May also reduce buildup of sulphide through oxidation of sulphide in rhizosphere or inhibiting activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria Key conclusions: The authors make several key conclusions given their results: The results of the field and greenhouse experiments do not match, in that A. germinans was found in the portion of the forest with the highest sulphide conditions, but seedlings were found to be highly sensitive to low redox and high sulphide concentrations. Hypotheses are given that i) other controls on presence of R. mangle in this region are stronger than sulphide - A. germinans interactions, ii) may be a result of other factors (propagule dispersion, predation, competition), or iii) adult trees may exhibit different tolerances than seedlings The two-way effect of redox and sulphide on roots (and roots on redox) make it difficult to infer mechanistic processes from correlative studies Other notes: Seawater is the primary source of sulphate for reduction by dissimilatory sulphate reducing bacteria. H2S may be present in degrees to be toxic to mangroves, particularly seedlings. 3.2.5 McKee, 1995 “Seedling recruitment patterns in a Belizean mangrove forest” (McKee 1995) Key significance: This study examines the relative influence of edaphic and dispersal related characteristics on species patterning of mangroves in the Twin Cays (Belize). The study is unique in that it does well to look at the effects of multiple hypotheses (ecophysiology vs. dispersal properties) on zonation. Research design: Transects were laid perpendicular to the shoreline and extended through different “zones” of mangrove species. Plots were stablished along the transects and edaphic chracteristics as well as seedling densities and forest structure were collected. Additionally, tests of seedling growth were performed by transplanting individuals to forest plots of different mangrove parent species (but similar edaphic conditions). Propagules were collected and measured to examine dispersal properties. Key results: McKee concludes that different factors were more important for different species. In particular: R. mangle - Majority of variation in seedling density was explained by distance to parent trees, which would indicate dispersal properties were dominant controls A. germinans - Availability of resources, specifically light and NH4 explained majority of seedling density, indicating that nutrient limitations were primary controls. L. racemosa - A mix of dispersal and ecophysiological controls were found to explain seedling densities; however, seedlings were rare throughout the forest and thus the site conditions are likely too stressful for L. racemosa to exhibit canopy dominance. In relation to seedling survival, the following is concluded: dispersal and establishment properties (related to predation, dessication or inability to root) were primary causes of seedling mortality (i.e., during the establishment phase) following establishment, physico-chemical factors such as salinity, flooding or nutrient availability were found to largely determine survival of seedlings There are a number of nice figures that relate species zone to different criteria, but a nice visualization of quantifying relative density of species zonation is shown below (may be worth recreating for Krabi and Pak Panang): **Other notes:** McKee collects a number of edaphic variables (e.g., salinity, sulphide, redox potential, etc.) and then uses PCA to extract three ecologically relevant “factors” that she uses to associate with seedling establishment and survival: i) salinity, ii) inundation, and iii) nutrients/resources. This appears to be a clever way of dealing with emergent properties and controls on mangroves and may be of interest for further examining interactive factors. 3.2.6 Sherman, 1998 “Soil-plant interactions in a neotropical mangrove forest: Iron, phosphorus and sulfur dynamics” (Sherman, Fahey, and Howarth 1998) Key contribution: This study examines the interactions of species distribution and select nutrients along a 3 km transect in the Dominican Republic. Species distributions, nutrients and abiotic factors were found to covary along the transect, with different processes dominating pathways in the lower versus upper intertidal regions. Research design: A 3 kilometer transect was laid out through the forest and 14 permanent, 30 m radius plots were established to measure species composition and surface and soil water biogeochemistry from 6 different dates over a two year period. Key results: Salinity - The salinity levels along the transect decreased as the tidal influence decreased and the influence of fresh water from rivers increased. Additionally, salinity was found to be higher at soil depths of 50 cm than the surface water. Sulfate - Sulfate levels reflected changes in salinity. Sulfate was constant in concentration until 1700 m into the forest (the approximate reach of tidal inundation), at which poin it steadily declined. Sulfate concentrations were deeper in deep soil water than surface waters. Species presence - Presence of Rhizophora was significantly correlated with salinity and sulfate concentrations of deep soilwater; A. germinans was significantly negatively correlated with deep soilwater salinity and sulfate. L. racemosa was not correlated with salinity, but was significantly correlated with surface water total phosphorus. Many of the other surface water soil parameters were not correlated with species distributions. Key conclusions: The correlations between species distribution and soil chemistry parameters are not necessarily uni-directional. Others have shown that mangrove trees may have significant influence on the chemistry of the soil (e.g., McKee 1993 - oxidiation of rhizosphere which modifies redox potential and sulfide concentrations) The patterns across phosphorus, sulfate, alkalinity and pyrite (Fe) concentrations across the transect were found to be largely controlled by sulfate reduction and its associated chemical reactions. The nutrient dynamics of fringe vs basin forests vary, and are reflected in physiological strategies by different species. For example, R. mangle has higher nutrient resorption rates than A. germinans. Strong interactions appear to exist between hydrology, species distributions and soil dynamics. In the lower intertidal basin, physical processes appeared to dominate biogeochemical cycling because of high export rates of material. Chemical and biological processes in the upper intertidal region are more important given the lower amount of nutrient export. 3.2.7 Krauss, 2008 “Environmental drivers in mangrove establishment and early development: A review” (Krauss et al. 2008) Key contribution: This is likely the most comprehensive and up to date review of ecophysiology and mangrove development in mangroves. This should be reviewed several times. Five central paradigms - Krauss et al provide five central paradigms that shape a lot of the work thinking and work related to mangrove eco-physiology: Lack of a functional understory in most mangrove forests - often have seedlings and saplings, but no vines, herbaceous plants or shrubs. Several studies have concluded that terrestrial understory species have just not adapted shade or salinity tolerance (or both) Inundation classifications - studies have shown that species are found in distinctive zones, but also that many species of mangroves are capable of colonizing a wide range of inundation frequencies; one of the earliest definitions of inundation classes was given by Watson, 1928 Salinity tolerance, zonation and biomass allocation - Much of this work has been forwarded by M. Ball, e.g., see Ball 1988, Section 3.2.3. The interaction of inundation, salinity, soil saturation and fertility has been found to explain zonation in many instances, though not necessarily all. Mangrove zonation is a hypothesis-rich field. Interrelatedness of nutrient enrichment, growth and herbivory - Tradeoffs exist between slow growth, defense against herbivory and nutrient limitation. Field experiments may address nutrient limitation to understand growth rates and relative survival/establishment strategies Geomorphological classification - A number of geomorphological classifications have been proposed. Temperature - Temperature largely important for two considerations: Controls the geographical extent of mangroves globally (cold limits); different species have been shown to have different tolerances (Avicennia spp. typically seen in coldest conditions) Excessive heat can impact photosynthetic functioning and damage plants through direct cellular damage mechanistic understanding of how temperatures affect mangrove individuals (extreme heat or cold stress) is lacking and needs further research Atmospheric CO2 - For a given amount of nutrients, higher CO2 concentrations will often increases relative growth rates, however, the particular growth seen will likely vary significantly across species. Salinity - Salinity is one of the major environmental conditions that mangroves have to have evolved to be able to handle a wide range of conditions exist upon which mangroves have to be able to tolerate Given high salinity concentrations in the external environments, mangroves have to maintain osmotic potentials below these levels (~ -2.5 to -6.0 MPa). Inorganic molecules are stored in the vacuoles, whereas organic salt molecules are maintained in the non-vacuolar spaces to help regulate salinity and protect functioning. A variety of mechanisms exist to maintain photosynthesis under saline conditions, but the two are largely decoupled in that salt flux to leaves does not increase with higher transpiration. Light - Interactive effects between levels of light and salinity exist, thus need to consider the two in concert. The combination of the saline environment and high levels of solar incidence create a high risk for photoinhibition (in which solar incidence is greater than can be used and may damage functioning). Species of mangroves differ in their strategies to avoid photoinhibition, e.g., vertical leaf angles of Rhizophora spps whereas Bruguiera spps have larger xanthophyll pigment pools Biomass growth may change depending upon salinity vs. light levels, and may be different across species Presence of light gaps may be particularly important for certain species (e.g., Rhizophora). There are a number of studies beyond (Sherman, Fahey, and Battles 2000) that have investigated gap dynamics and are worth looking at. Nutrients - Mangrove ecosystems are largely nutrient limited ecosystems due to infertility of upland soils and often a lack of terrigenous input. Response of mangrove trees to nutrient additions are common to that of other forests, often with increased growth rates and reduced nutrient use efficiencies. Several traits of mangroves exist to deal with nutrient limitations: allocation of biomass to roots (particularly fine roots) relative to shoots large maternal reserves for propagules high amounts of nutrient resorption - resorption of nutrients from leaves prior to senescence high nutrient use efficiency for photosynthesis schlerophylly and tissue quality – reduces both decomposition and herbivory mutualistic associations, e.g., with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae or encrusting epibionts (?) In addition, different strategies exist for high nutrient environments: investment in leaf development and rapid growth rather than defense related traits high PWUE - high extraction of water which salinizes the soil and may exclude competitors The availability of nutrients vs other environmental conditions often induces tradeoffs among different species. Flooding and SLR - Flooding of mangroves greatly changes the soil conditions within very short time frames (less than a day). Mangrove roots may metabolize anaerobically for short periods of time, but more effective to avoid root hypoxia through internal aeration. Mangroves may aerate the rhizosphere through loss of O2 from roots, which oxidizes the soil and protects against harmful sulfide. The oxidized rhizosphere may also reduce flows of O2 from the plant to the soil during periods of inundation. However, mangroves are facultative halophytes and thus grow best under species-specific optimal levels of salinity and inundation, but growth levels generally are reduced under conditions beyond their particular optimum. Prolonged inundation, for example through sea level rise, reduces growth rates which may negate the effects CO2 fertilization. Over more short time periods, growth was reduced quickly but normal metabolic functioning quickly rebounded (after a period of a few weeks). Biota - Interacting effects of microconditions within the forest and biota, particularly insects or crabs that are predators of mangroves trees may be significant in establishement of seedlings. Additionally they can play important roles as ecosystem engineers, aerating soil, changing microtopography, or altering the texture of the soil. References "],
["trophic-interactions.html", "3.3 Trophic interactions", " 3.3 Trophic interactions 3.3.1 Smith, 1987 “Seed predation in relation to tree dominance and distribution in mangrove forests” (Smith 1987) Key contribution: This is one of the earliest examinations of the effects of predation (by grapsid crabs) on propagule survival for different species. They found significant relationships between propagule predation and nutritional content, as well as location within the intertidal floor. The results led them to conclude that propagule predation is a significant factor in defining zonation in mangrove forests. Experimental design: Propagules were tethered to twine strings and monitored over 18 days in 5 replicate plots in each of three forest types (high, intermediate and low conspecific dominance) for each of the five species. Additionally, propagules of each of the five species were analyzed for nutritional content and related to predation patterns using PCA. Key results: The findings show that differential predation for certain species does occur. In particular, predation on A. marina in the mid intertidal was found to explain the relative absence of parent A. marina trees in the mid-intertidal section of the forest. Rates of predation of A. marina were found to be higher than in the low or high intertidal regions. With the exception of Ceriops tagal, amount of predation was significantly negatively correlated with conspecific dominance (i.e., low dominance by parent trees led to high predation rates) across the other four species. 3.3.2 Smith et al, 1989 “Comparisons of seed predation in tropical, tidal forests from three continents” (Smith et al. 1989) Key contribution: This study extends (Smith 1987) to examine patterns of propagule predation in four distinct localities: Florida, Panama, Australia and Malaysia. Smith et al conclude that propagule predation has a significant influence on spatial patterning of mangrove species, though to varying degrees depending on propagule species and also species of predator. Smith et al term the hypothesis that spatial assemblages are a result of predation as the “dominance-predation” model. Study design: Following the methods of (Smith 1987), replicate plots with secured propagules were established in stands with dominance of propagule parent trees and absence of propagule parent trees. The seedlings were monitored for 4 days to identify predation such that they are incapable of establishing (i.e., 50% mass consumed, taken down hole, or radicle and hypocotyl consumed). Key results: The study confirms the prior work in that species of Avicennia were completely consumed in stands in which their parent trees were rare or absent, but not consumed in stands where they were abundant. The findings for Rhizophora species were a bit more mixed, with the “dominance-predation” model holding true in Malaysia and Australia, but failing in the North American sites. In Florida, no Rhizophora propagules were consumed. In Panama, more propagules were consumed in the Rhizophora-dominated site relative to the Avicennia-dominated site. More Bruguiera propagules were consumed where it was rare than it was common in Malaysia, and the reverse held true for Australia. Differences in predator distribution may explain some of the variability. In particular, grapsid crabs did not exist at the site in Florida, which may explain lack of consumption of Rhizophora. In forests with only snail consumers, only Avicennia were consumed. This may be a result of the feeding mechanisms of crabs versus snail, and the physical structure of Rhizophora vs. Avicennia propagules (i.e., crabs are able to rip through tough hypocotyl of Rhizophora propagules). 3.3.3 Cannicci et al, 2008 “Faunal impact on vegetation structure and ecosystem function in mangrove forests: A review” (Cannicci et al. 2008) Key contribution: This is a well-written review on faunal impacts on forest structure and ecosystem function within mangroves. It does not necessarily relate to purely herbivory (which many of the studies related to mangrove predation do), but also considers some of the community ecology aspects important for ecosytem functioning. Key notes: Insects - Most common forms of insect herbivory are: Leaf-feeding - can be very significant and produce massive leaf-loss events Wood-boring - very limited evidence (Feller in Belize), but has found to produce leaf-loss as great or greater than direct leaf herbivory. Insects bore wood on branches and leaves along the branch are subsequently lost, which can create significant canopy gaps Flower/fruit/seed-feeding - may be a result of reduced biomass allocation to reproductive tissues following leaf herbivory or other damage; or may be a result of direct feeding on propagules The costs of leaf herbivory and stress on the plant are a function of both the direct impacts, as well as the additional biomass and resources needed to be put into regenerating leaves or building defensive mechanisms. Toxins (E. allagocha; Euphorbiaceae), tannins or thicker leaves may require resource inputs that could otherwise be allocated towards growth. Ants are the most dominant insects in mangroves, both numerically and energetically, despite the difficult floor conditions in which many require. Ant communities consist of both terrestrial species as well as those endemic to mangroves. Although data is limited, studies have shown that ants in mangroves can significantly reduce the presence of herbivorous pests (note that this is decoupled from improving plant “performance” per se). Crabs - Feeding patterns of crabs vary by species within mangrove. Some predominantly feed on leaf litter, whereas others have adopted arborial life style and feed largely on green leaves. They scrape the leaves which likely has similar impacts on tree fitness as other herbivores. Crabs understood as main agents of high leaf litter turnover in mangroves. In particular, sesarmid crabs in Southeast Asia are main consumers of leaf litter, though magnitude of influence is highly variable. In Neotropics, ocypodidae crabs are found to be most influential on leaf litter dynamics. In general, however, feeding behavior of crabs is poorly understood within mangroves. Biomass cycling of crabs: Low assimilation rates of leaf litter (&lt;50%) Additionally, approximately 60% of dry weight is defecated Crab fecal matter may be of higher nutritional content than leaf litter, acting as food source for benthic organisms Shredding of leaves occurs, and bacterial diversity on crab fecal matter found to be 70 times greater than that of raw leaf litter “Reduced competition from crabs” - Several mechanisms have been proposed for reductions in seedling/sapling competition due to propagule predation: Predation-dependence model - inverse relationship between rate of predation and dominance of particular species Smith has found support for it, whereas a number of other studies have found a lack of evidence in support of the hypothesis and thus have proposed alternative mechanisms Canopy-gap mediated model - hypothesizes that predation is more intense under closed canopies than in light gaps Has led some to propose a “mutualism” between sesarmid crabs and mangrove trees in that crabs reduce competition and allow established saplings to compete while mangroves provide food Flooding regime model - time for terrestrial foragers is limited due to variation in exposure of the forest floor Sousa found otherwise “Bioturbation of soil” - Impacts of crabs as ecosystem engineers may have strong implications for soil quality within mangroves: Sesarmid crabs were found to significantly reduce aluminum and sulfur contents of soil Fiddler crabs may increase the depth of iron reduction Burrowing create preferential flow pathways which may flush out accumulated salts, particularly within rhizospheres Molluscs - Most well represented taxon along with decapod crustaceans, however their ecological role is poorly understood. Snails can be significant feeders of leaf-litter, feeding during both low and high tides in which they chemically sense leaves underwater Sponges may play a role in inducing growth of adventitious rootlets that absorb ammonium and other nitrogenous compounds Oysters and barnacles may have negative effects on root growth, and may also result in breaking of roots due to harvesting by humans 3.3.4 Sousa, 2011 “Trophic interactions in coastal and estuarine mangrove forest ecosystems” (Sousa and Dangremond 2011) Key contribution: This is an extensive review on trophic interactions in mangroves. It extends beyond conventional consideration of herbivory and the effects of trophic interactions on forest structure by including discussion of faunal interactions. Productivity - Mangroves have been found to have higher aboveground net primary productivity rates (mean ~14 Mg DW / ha) than terrestrial tropical forests (mean 5 Mg DW / ha). Methods of measuring NPP are varied and inaccurate, and thus the estimates provided within the literature are likely to be quite coarse. Little research has examined the productivity of phytoplanton in tidal waters or cyanobacteria on aboveground root systems, though some studies have shown this to be half or more of ecosystem productivity. Herbivory - Primary component of energy flow through ecosystem, yet relatively unstudied within mangrove ecosystems. Insect herbivory - General consensus is that insect herbivory is not a significant consideration, although this is likely based on little evidence. Methodological issues constrain our current estimates of the degree of leaf herbivory by insects. Of the studies that exist, rates of leaf removal are relatively low at 7.6% for Avicennia spps and 5% for Rhizophora spps. Longitudinal studies that have followed leaf herbivory through the duration of its development (from bud to the end of the study period) have found herbivory rates to be much higher (10-30%). Additionally, occasional mass herbivory events due to emergence of lepidopterans can defoliate massive expanses of trees. Caterpillars emerge and within three months trees have lost &gt; 75% of foliage. Crab herbivory - Majority of crabs forage on forest floor, but some exhibit (almost) purely arborial habits Some are found in both terrestrial and low tree canopies, whereas four species of sesarmid crabs are purely arboreal (come to floor rarely if ever). Aratus pisonii - Atlantic/Caribbean/Eastern Pacific; feeds on young leaves largely from R mangle Parasesarma leptosoma - Indo-West Pacific; feeds on young leaves Armases elegans - West Africa, feeds on young leaves Selatium brockii - Feeds on algae growing on tree trunks Stem boring - wood-eating beetles and moths can have significant impacts on forest structure, particularly through the opening of small gaps within the forest via death of branches. Coccotrypes rhizophorae - Rhizophora specialist beetle that bores roots, wood and propagules; can change morphology of root systems (Atlantic/Caribbean/Eastern Pacific) Coccotrypes fallax - the congener to C rhizophorae in the Indo-West Pacific Propagule predation - Propagule predation may occur before or after dispersal: “Predispersal predation” occurs when propagules are still on parent trees. Often have boring insects (e.g., C. rhizophorae) which may ultimately cause premature dropping of propagules, their death, or reduced growth rates of seedlings following establishment. C. rhizophorae lay eggs in Rhizophora propagules and can greatly damage the propagules. “Postdispersal predation” - a relative boom in research following Smith’s tethered propagules studies. Although findings corroborate with his conclusions per Avicennia propagules in some cases, other studies have shown the predation-dependence model to not hold true. Detrivory and decomposition: Outwelling hypothesis - idea that substantial amounts of organic matter are exported to adjacent estuaries, which supports dense populations of detritivores and secondary and tertiary consumers Odum and Heald’s work in Florida exemplified the process by which outwelling of organic matter in mangroves may occur: Mangrove leaf litter drops and undergoes decomposition by bacteria, fungi and protozoa Crabs and other detritivores further consume leaf litter, breaking it up into finer pieces Organic matter in fine, processed form is exported via tidal flows Exported OM fuels marine and detritus-based food chains (postulated) The importance of this particular pathway has since been questioned, as supporting evidence has been largely been circumstantial. The circumstantial evidence of this pathway may indicate a large contribution of DOC. Outwelling of OM likely occurs in most tidally inundated and riverine forests, though the degree to which it happens depends on site, season and years. Different patterns of outwelling exist for basin forests separated by berms, in which only highest tides flush the system, versus riverine or fringe forests that undergo more periodic flushing. Retention and recycling of carbon and nitrogen - export of organic matter and nutrients is also greatly controlled by recycling of nutrients within the system. Detritus-feeding crustaceans - A review of studies finds that, on average, 57% of detritus is either consumed or buried by crabs. Studies have found a strong preference by crabs for older, more decomposed leaf litter in which C:N ratios are much lower, and tannin content and toughness of the leaf are much reduced. Nevertheless, the C:N ratio is still quite high and thus crabs likely need to look for additional N sources. Studies have suggested that this may come from grazing on algae or predation of animal tissue (crustaceans, mollusks, annelids, insects and fish). Detritus-feeding mollusks - consumption of detritus by mollusks can be significant in addition to that of crustaceans. Deposit-feeding crabs - largely comprise of fiddler crabs; feed on bacteria, microalgae and detrital material (often bacteria, smaller diatoms and protozoa); assimilation efficiency is much higher for bacteria than microalgae Litter decomposition - the nutritional content of leaves from different species varies, but in general decomposition improves the nutritional quality over time. Tannins are high but are leached from the leaf quite rapidly; following leaching of soluble compounds, lignocellulose is primary component; bacteria digest lignocellulose at a much faster rate than other decomposters, and animals cannot digest lignocellulose Wood and root decomposition - a higher proportion of lignocellulose exists in wood and roots, thus decomposition is much slower than for leaves. Little is known about the functional groups and diversity of fungi in mangroves, but they may play a significant role in decomposition of wood and roots. Additionally, wood-boring insects with mutualistic relationships with bacteria that can process lignocellulose may be important for decomposition of woody biomass (e.g., termites). Predation - In addition, the review provides a discussion of predator-prey interactions but I have not included notes here as it is beyond the direct scope of the qualifying exam. References "],

In essence, they seek to understand the stark decreases in species diversity in the ACEP region relative to IWP. Key notes: Two primary hypotheses for the global distribution of mangrove species diversity exist: “Center of origin” hypothesis - holds that mangrove taxa originated in the IWP and then dispersed to other parts of the world “Vicariance hypothesis” - taxa evolved around the Tethys Sea and regional species diversity has results from in situ diversification after continential drift Research design: The authors consider primarily five lines of evidence to parse whether the Center of Origin versus Vicariance Hypothesis is more likely to explain current patterns of species diversity. The five lines of evidence they use are: Fossil records - distribution of fossils all around Tethys would support vicariance, whereas fossils in Eastern Tethys (IWP) would support Center of Origin. Available area: Center of origin - species richness negatively correlated with distance from center of origin rather than available area Vicarance - species richness should be correlated with availble area Distributions of fauna - Would expect to see similarities in diversity anomaly between mangrove tree species and the fauna that inhabit the forests Geographical nestedness - geographical nestedness may occur through colonization of far-reaching areas by select species, or by extinction of taxa following vicariance. Nestedness of entire communities - nestedness of mangroves and all gastropods as described above Key results: Ellison et al conclude that the lines of evidence provides support for the vicariance hypothesis. In particular, strong species-area relationships were found, evidence in the fossil record, and a unimodality in the distribution of gastropod genera were found to be convinving evidence in support of the vicariance hypothesis. 3.4.2 Mckee &amp; Faulkner, 2000 “Mangrove peat analysis and reconstruction of vegetation history at the Pelican Cays, Belize” Key contribution: This study examines the historical development of peat formation in the Pelican Cays in Belize. This work is a precursor to (McKee, Cahoon, and Feller 2007) which studied the formation of peat deposits in the Belize cays in depth. Study design: A transect across Pelican Cays was laid out that spanned Rhizophora fringe, Avicennia basin/woodlands, a treeless area with standing water, and the same pattern to the other coast. Peat cores to 0.5 m and 2 m were taken and soil and peat characteristics were described. Key results: Upon identifying roots, shoots and leaf fragments within the peat to species type, the authors were able to infer the successional process of the forest. In stands that are currently Avicennia dominated, Rhizophora roots make up the majority of the deep peat, indicating they once dominated that stand. In addition, root biomass was found to make up the majority (~80%) of the peat biomass. 3.4.3 Valiela et al, 2001 “Mangrove forests: One of the world’s threatened major tropical environments” (Valiela, Bowen, and York 2001) Key contribution: Following widespread recognition of the loss of other tropical ecosystems (rain forests and coral reefs), this paper makes the argument that mangroves are under-appreciated but perhaps even more threatened than these other ecosystems. Study design: They compile data on the global status of mangroves from the literature, and assess to what degree human activities have contributed to their loss. They use the Global Mangrove Atlas coupled with estimates of status and extent of mangroves across different countries to look at rates of loss for different continents and globally. They assess the human-based impacts on mangrove extent by correlating lost mangrove extent with GDP and also coastal population density. Key results: The study estimates that approximately 35% of mangroves have been lost from their “original” extent (i.e., the earliest year in which data could be found; 1920s for some data from Africa and Asia). Global mean rates of loss were approximately 2% per year, with continent specific rates ranging from 1 to 3.6% (3.6% was for the Americas). They attribute approximately two-thirds of the loss of mangroves directly to human related activities. The correlation between GDP and loss of mangrove extent is significant, whereas little correlation between loss of mangroves and coastal population density is found. Furthermore, Valiela et al delve into the importance of mariculture for mangrove habitat losses. Conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds is the dominant driver of deforestation, and has additional indirect impacts on the environment such as: Reductions in offshore shrimp stocks due to need for juveniles Impacts on offshore fisheries that are used as feed within the shrimp ponds 3.4.4 Krauss et al, 2014 “How mangrove forests adjust to rising sea level” (Krauss et al. 2014) Key contribution: This review differs from others in that it focuses on the role that vegetation plays in maintaining soil surface elevations in mangroves. Key notes: As of 2010, current rate of mean sea level rise is 3.2 +/- 0.4 mm per yr (based on satellite altimetry), though these rates likely vary locally. IPCC projections (AR5) estimate SLR rates of 3 - 5 mm / yr over the next 100 years. “Relative sea level rise” refers to the rate of sea level rise in conjunction with subsidence or vertical accretion of coastal areas (i.e., consideration of both eustatic SLR as well as changes in the mangrove surface elevation). Surface elevation changes are a result of both biotic and abiotic processes. Abiotic processes include: Inorganic sedimentation Groundwater fluxes (anthropogenic depletion of groundwater reservoirs may be significant) Deep land movements Whereas biological processes include: Plant litter and woody debris deposition Root accumulation Sediment trapping by vegetative structures Algal mat development on soil surface Other processes include acute deposition from storm events, or feedback processes between vegetation systems and degree of inundation. Aerial roots and sedimentation - Different functional root types will influence sedimentation rates differently, and through different processes. Pneumatophores are believed to retain deposited soil better than other types, whereas stilt roots may result in greater deposition of sediment. Litter and woody debris accumulation - In absence of tidal flushing as well as crabs and other organisms responsible for turnover of organic matter, accumulation of OM may be significant. Benthic mat formation - Intact algal mats may bind sediments and resist erosion. Subsurface root accumulation - May be the most important biological contributor to surface elevation change in some settings (carbonate settings or other settings with limited mineral sediment input). Can be significant enough to affect the direction and rate of change in surface elevation. Refractory nature of root tissues and existence within anaerobic environment are prone to slow rates of decomposition Rates of SEC were correlated with both fine and coarse root production “Specific root length” is a measure of the length of root per unit mass; mangroves have more dense roots than tropical species, which is likely due to anoxic conditions Influence of roots on surface elevation is bidirectional; death of roots can result in collapse of roots under weight of soil Factors affecting root contributions to soil accretion: In general, the influence or roots on SEC is a relative function of production and decomposition of roots. Salinity - response of root growth to salinity is species dependent, but root growth only slightly reduced with increasing salinity; increases in root to shoot ratio may actually be a result of increased aboveground biomass rather than increased root biomass (for example through nutrient release) Nutrients - in general do not see an increase in root production, but rather increases in biomass production aboveground; in some settings may even see decrease in elevation due to release of nutrient-limited microbial communities and thus decomposition of belowground organic matter Flooding - effect of flooding on root-production is hard to identify, and may occur in both directions depending on setting (increasing root-production in basin type settings, decreasing root production in others) Soil texture - high bulk density decreases root growth due to more difficult conditions of growing Disturbance - may be biotic or abiotic: Largely hypothesized that organisms may influence root production, though the mechanisms and degree to which this occurs is unknown Acute deposition of sediments from storm events may kill trees, or may provide much needed substrate for subsiding forests; root zone expansion following deposition of sediment may be significant and may further increase surface elevations Lightning may kill trees, causing root collapse and alter microhabitat hydrology (Sherman, 2000) Climatic and environmental feedbacks: Precipitation – seasonal or storm based variability in rainfall can cause swelling or subsidence of peat layers or water table Elevated CO2 - likely that increases in CO2 concentrations will improve biomass growth, though most of this is likely to occur in the aboveground systems Feedbacks related to SLR - growth rates may increase sharply for a short period of time, but eventually fall off under prolonged inundation 3.4.5 Gilman, 2008 “Threats to mangroves from climate change and adaptation options: A review” (Gilman et al. 2008) Key significance: The paper reviews the dominant threats to mangroves from climate change related impacts. In addition, they provide several suggestions for measures that can be taken to potentially bolster mangrove resilience to climate change related pressures. Key notes: The key threats to mangroves from climate change as identified by the paper are: Sea level rise - relative sea level rise is a key threat, and is relatively difficult to measure as tidal gauges may not accurately reflect sea level conditions within the actual forest of interest. Mangroves are vulnerable when they are unable to increase surface elevation at a rate greater than sea level rise, which is due to both surface accretion as well as belowground processes. Considerable feedbacks exist in which increasing surface elevation may decrease hydroperiod and thus sediment accretion, or alternatively subsidence may promote hydroperiod and increased sediment accretion. Three general response of mangroves to changing sea-levels are: Stable site-specific relative sea-level - sea-level not changing relative to mangrove and thus mangrove is “stable” Site-specific relative sea subsidence - mangrove margins migrate seawards Site-specific relative sea rising - mangroves retreat landward; may expand into landward areas Other factors beyond sea level rise are also important for determining resilience of mangroves to SLR. Four main factors are identified: Rate of SLR relative to changes in mangrove surface elevation Species composition - different species have different rates of change in sediment elevation Physiographic setting - slope of land upslope and ability of mangroves to migrate landwards Cumulative effects of stressors - effect ability to persist and also colonize new areas Extreme high water events - The impacts of high water events is relatively poorly understood at present, but the impacts may be significant or may induce extensive stress in mangroves. Storms - Winds, precipitation and storm surge heights are expected to increase with climate change. More intense storms may damage or defoliate mangroves, but may also cause erosion, peat collapse, or otherwise adversely impact edaphic conditions. Precipitation - Projections are for more precipitation, but in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Changes in precipitation (total as well as seasonal amounts) may impact vegetation growth, soil conditions, and also ability of the mangrove to migrate landwards or seawards. Temperature - The main effects of temperature on mangroves are: Changing species composition Changing phenological patterns Increasing mangrove productivity where temperature doesn’t exceed an upper threshold Expanding mangrove ranges to northern latitudes Atmospheric CO2 - Likely to improve productivity of trees in low-salinity environments, but may not have substantial impact on those in high-salinity environments. Recommendations for improving resilience - The author provide a list of recommendations for improving mangrove resilience to the impacts of sea level rise: “No regret” reductions of stress – Simply better management techniques that reduce anthropogenic stresses on existing mangrove forests Manage activites that directly influence sediment elevation – Not over-depleting groundwater reservoirs or cutting off landward supplies sediment to the forest will improve its ability to respond to SLR Managed retreat – Manage landscapes such that mangroves have a region in which they can retreat towards System of protected area networks – Ensuring representation of mangrove types within protected area networks or replication of identical communities to improve resilience to risk (i.e., “portfolios” of communities) Mangrove restoration – Restoring impacted areas through reforestation or afforestation Regional monitoring network – Using standardized techniques to monitor and examine key criteria (e.g., SLR and surface elevation change a la Sasmito 2016) Education and outrech 3.4.6 Sasmito et al 2016 “Can mangroves keep pace with contemporary sea level rise? A global data review” (Sasmito et al. 2016) Key contribution: This study systematically reviews data on surface elevation change (SEC) and surface accretion rate (SAR) in mangroves to examine their ability to keep pace with projections of sea level rise globally. Of critical importance is: Surface accretion rate (SAR) – process of sediment accumulation on the surface of the forest floor Surface elevation change (SEC) – a function of biotic and abiotic processes, such as growth of roots or compaction or subsidence due to OM decomposition Sub-surface change (SSC) – the difference between SAR and SEC The data review examines studies that use Rod Surface Elevation Table and Marker Horizon methods to examine elevation change. Key results Only 19 studies with data from some 74 sites were found through the literature review. Running different models of the influence of geomorphological setting and management type (restored, plantation, natural, etc.) on SAR, SEC and SSC found them to be influential. In particular, basin mangroves may be better able to adapt to SLR than fringe mangroves or those on islands with shallow tidal ranges (and thus little sedimentation). The study nods to the importance of belowground processes in conjunction with geomorphological setting and management practices for SEC. Extrapolation of SAR and SEC rates with projected SLR shows that mangroves may be able to keep pace with low (RCP 2.6) emissions trajectories, but are unlikely to cope with high emissions pathways (RCP 8.5) regardless of geomorphological setting or management regime. Additionally, there is more systematic monitoring of SEC using RSET-MH in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, SW Thailand and Vietnam underway. This data will better inform the ability of mangroves to respond to sea level rise. Additional thought – how can this be worked into my research trajectory? Relevance for research: Interesting in that they call for standardized global monitoring of surface elevation data. Could potentially work into remote sensing of geomorphology in mangroves.

["carbon.html", "3.5 Carbon", " 3.5 Carbon 3.5.1 Kristensen et al, 2008 “Organic carbon dynamics in mangrove ecosystems: A review” (Kristensen et al. 2008) Key significance: Origin of mangrove organic C Stable isotopes can be effective in determining sourcing of organic C in sediments. Mangrove sediments are generally relatively rich in organic C, with a median value of 2.2% and 28% of values between 2 and 5%. Chemical composition of mangrove litter Rhizophora leaves in particular have undergone extensive work on their chemical construction. Rhizophora leaves are comprised of: carbohydrates, amino acids, lignin-derived phenols, tannins, fatty acids, triterpenoids, and n-aklanes. Mangrove litter thus provide a particular signature that is preserved during transformations and may be helpful in sourcing of organic C in mangroves. Carbohydrates form the bulk of mangrove tissue with rates of ~10-30% in leaves, and up to 65% in woody tissues. Amino acids from the second most Tannins form the third most. Mangrove have relatively high contents of tannins, which affects the feeding patterns of crabs. Leaching of tannins from leaf litter is important step in decomposition of leaf litter. Phenols derived from lignins form a smaller portion, and are more refractory than other molecular compounds. Fatty acids are useful in identifying sources of OM as they are uniquitous in living organisms and have biological specificity. Foodwebs and role of fauna in OM processing Mangrove derived OM is key source, but additionally have OM sources from epiphytic algae, benthic microalgae, bacteria and fungi, and macroalgae and mixed OM imported by tidal currents. Fauna play important roles in OM dynamics, for example processing of litter into smaller pieces, as well as transport of litter into belowground pools. Important in nutrient dynamics, oxidation of soil, and oxidation of reduced compounds. Organic matter decomposition and mangrove sediment biogeochemistry Leaf letter that is not exported enters sediment and is processed by microorganisms. Stepwise process of decay is: Significant leaching of soluble organic substances - carbohydrates, tannins and phenolic compounds Extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis - mediated by aerobic and anaerobic prokaryotes and marine mycelial decomposers fungi particularly adapted for capture of cellulose-rich litter Various controls on the speed at which leaf litter is decomposed exist, for example how wet it is (controls access to microbial decomposers), or the C:N ratio of the litter (higher N = faster decomp rate). Sedimentary decomposition pathways occur largely under anaerobic conditions: Large OM molecules split to small moieties by fermenting prokaryotes These molecules then oxidized completely to CO2 by wide variety of anaerobic microorganisms via electron acceptors in following sequence: Mn4+, NO3-, Fe3+, and SO42- Aerobic and sulfate reduction are most important processes, and account for approximately 40-50% of reduction each. Thus, many mangroves have reduced inorganic S in form of FeS2 and S0. Denitrification may be significant in areas impacted by sewage. Sulfur reduction is hampered by presence of more ready electron acceptors (O2 and Fe3+), and thus in environments in which Fe3+ is high, sulfur reduction may be less significant than Fe respiration. Methanogenesis would occur if all electron acceptors are depleted; however ocean water provides steady supply of S and thus largely prevents system from reaching a point in which methanogenesis occurs. The type of respiration that occurs is influenced by the forest conditions, in particular age: younger forests with potentially sandy substratum may exhibit more aerobic and Fe reduction whereas older forests with strong organic C input may exhibit sulfate reduction. Burial and permanent storage in sediments C burial depends on environmental conditions. For example, older stands have higher productivity and consequently higher efficiency of C burial in sediments. There is also proportionally greater C burial in low intertidal. Outwelling hypothesis Clear evidence that significant amounts (~half) of mangrove litter is exported to near coastal ecosystem, the use of this OM in coastal food webs is inconsistent. The influence of OM exported from mangroves is likely limited to within a km or 2 from the forest. The lack of a major outwelling phenomena may be explained by: distribution of exported mangrove litter depends on hydrogeomorphology, which may result in direct sedimentation in immediate vicinity of the forest over the time-scale at which outwelling occurs, significant fraction of litter is lost as DOC Export of carbon to nearshore ecosystem is significant in mangroves and thus loss of mangrove globally may have had significant implications for DOC to the ocean. 3.5.2 Alongi, 2011 “Carbon payments for mangrove conservation: Ecosystem constraints and uncertainties of sequestration potential” (Alongi 2011) Key significance: This articles addresses the discrepancy between ecosystem services expected from mangroves versus the thermodynamic constraints that exist within mangroves. In particular, the author discusses C sequestration in reference to forest type and time-scales. Key notes: Woodroffe, 2002 outlines six ways in which mangroves develop in relation to sea-level: Static conditions - surface accretes asymptotically until sediment raises forest floor above tidal range Constantly rising sea level - floor accretes at pace similar to SLR Fluctuation SLR rates - forest floor accretes with time above tidal range Stable SL but episodic subsidence - floor accretes back to tidal range Rising SL and episodic subsidence - response is complex but overall pattern is net accretion Rising SL but no episodic subsidence or change in sediment volume - floor is set back or abandoned Sites are heterogeneous in sediment accumulation, and thus short-term or small-scale studies have a difficult time providing an accurate picture of actual sedimentation patterns. C fluxes: young vs. old, monospecific vs. mixed forests Mangroves are suitable for REDD+ schemes, but lack a common “mature” successional phase given repeated disturbance, which must be incorporated into understanding of C dynamics. Relationship between forest age and NPP shows prolonged maturity or arrested progression occurs under disturbance. Although photosynthesis asymptotes, contributions of organic C to soil components proceed over very long periods of time. In R. apiculata forests, there is considerable evidence that MSY is obtained from 30 year-old forests given maximum photosynthetic rates that occur. Studies in mangrove plantations show that mangroves generally adhere to the -3/2 self-thinning law. This would indicate that C payments after 30 years will begin to decrease, and thus these must be incorporated into long-term conservation plans. -3/2 self-thinning law is the regression slope of tree density vs tree diameter. Issue of uncertainty Net ecosystem productivity in mangroves has been estimated at 112 Tg C per yr (Bouillon 2008) and 155 Tg C per yr (Alongi, 2009). Many processes in mangroves are non-linear, which must be accounted for in PES schemes and management plans. 3.5.3 Alongi, 2012 “Carbon sequestration in mangrove forests” (Alongi 2012) Key significance: This article is Daniel Alongi’s own mechanistic review of carbon sequestration in mangroves. There is considerable overlap with some of the other reviews that are listed here. Key notes: Carbon allocation and ecosystem storage In understanding C sequestration in mangroves, it is critical to understand the various pools from C sequestration by mangrove trees: Approximately 50% is respired by trees, though this is rough estimate given limited data, particularly for root systems Root respiration and production is particularly difficult to measure Recent analyses suggest greater proportions of C may be allocated to roots in mangroves than other trees The relative dominance of the belowground pool in ecosystem C appears to be a global pattern. Most living roots are within top 40 cm of soil, but the sloughing off of fine roots can be considerable and be a large addition of C to soil. Large dead root pool may be a nutrient conserving mechanism, in that new roots can enter dead root channels and reassimilate released nutrients from decomposing biomass. Extensive root growth may also aid in uptake of water, other nutrients, as well as stabilize against tide and winds. Rates of soil accretion &amp; C sequestration Over short-term, C is stored in biomass whereas over long-term, C is stored primarily belowground. Sediment accretion averages 5 mm per yr globally, but some highly-impacted sites (e.g., in China) show rates of up to 44 mm per yr. Frequency of tidal inundation is the primary factor in determining the rate of accretion. Deforestation of mangroves results in collapse of peat soils and may result in significant emissions of CO2, which may be up to 2-10% of emissions from tropical deforestation. Global significance Mangroves account for approximately 3% of C sequestration though they occupy &lt;1% of total area of tropical forests. 3.5.4 Asner, 2013 “High-fidelity national carbon mapping for resource management and REDD+” (Asner et al. 2013) Key significance: This is Asner’s mapping of Carbon in Panama that exemplifies a scaling approach of plot-based to airborne lidar to satellite imagery. A key aspect of the study is that they also produce maps of uncertainty around C stocks for the entire country. Key notes: The study used lidar data top-of-canopy height (TCH) to scale allometric estimates of biomass, and then subsequently plugged that into a quantitative model at the national level that employed lidar and satellite based data of elevation, slope, climate and fractional canopy cover to carbon storage patterns. The process achieved uncertainties of ~10%, which they note is within the bounds of uncertainty for plot-based estimates of AGC. The plot based and lidar based data was scaled to the national level using two different techniques: a) a RandomForest algorithm, and b) stratification of satellite input variables into 2039 unique classes. Interestingly, the study also notes the cost of plot-based vs. RS field work on a per ha scale. While 1-ha plot-based measurements of AGC cost 3-5k USD, 1-ha of lidar data collection is estimated at 1 USD. Although the total cost of flying lidar for Panama was large, the cost at a per ha scale was rather affordable. The uncertainty in regions in which they flew lidar is extremely low relative to other regions. Key criticisms - Wayne’s key criticism is how they used the Chave generic allometric equation for all trees in the country, although I somewhat can understand the rationale here. 3.5.5 Alongi, 2014 “Carbon cycling and storage in mangrove forests” (Alongi 2014) Key significance: This ARMS review paper covers carbon dynamics in mangroves with a focus on both mechanistic processes as well as mean ecosystem and global budgets. The paper is an excellent overview of the state of knowledge on C dynamics in mangroves. Key notes: The primary sources of carbon within mangroves are: Trees that fix atmospheric carbon via photosynthesis Macroalgae colonizing aboveground roots and the forest floor Transport and deposition of materials from adjacent ecosystems Although the relative contributions depend upon site location and geomorphological conditions, most C is produced in sit and stored belowground. NPP Mangroves have high NPP, typically higher than that of other coastal systems, but relatively equivalent to coral reefs. Mangrove NPP rates are approximately equivalent to both humid tropical forests as well as peat swamp forests. Although inconclusive, there is evidence that disturbance may prolong maturation of forests and thus have long-term production and sequestration of C in mangroves (photosynthetic rate increases rapidly in first 20 years, but levels off without declining for up to 80 years). Sedimentation Mass balance approaches in mangroves determined to be highly inaccurate. Frequency of tidal inundation is primarily control on sedimentation rates, i.e., forests further from the sea experience less sedimentation. Size, shape and distribution patterns of trees are critical in sedimentation in mangroves. Burial rates of carbon in soils are estimated by difference between carbon losses (export, consumption and mineralization) and annual accumulation rates (rest is presumed to be preserved). Global estimate for soil C burial rate in mangroves is approximately 24 Tg C per yr. Relatively small on global scale, but is significant given their occupation of a relatively small amount of global coastal ocean area ~0.5%. Some estimates place deforestation of mangroves at comprising approximately 2-10% of global CO2 emissions from deforestation. Losing carbon Key losses of carbon are due to respiration and tidal export. Majority of respiration is from trees. Tidal export is a key process that is relatively poorly understood. May occur as: Particulate organic carbon - export of particulate organic matter (leaves, bark, branches, etc.); accounts for approximately 10-11% of terrestrial carbon input to ocean Dissolved organic carbon - organic carbon that is able to pass through a filter Dissolved inorganic carbon - mangrove contribution of DIC to ocean is disproportionate to areas of waterways and creeks; tidal pumping from forest floor is likely significant microbial metabolism in deep soil results in CO2 production, which dissolves in interstitial waters and is exported to coastal ocean (aerobic respiration and sulfate reduction are usually major pathways, though Fe and Mn reduction may also be important) Global carbon budget A schematic of the global carbon budget in mangroves is displayed below: Of key significance is that approximately 24 Tg C per yr is buried globally, and approximately 60% of mangrove NPP is estimates to be exported as dissolved and particular carbon to coastal ocean (~129 Tg C per yr).

The most significant contribution of the work is his conceptual model for soil formation, which is shown below: \\[soils = f(climate, organisms, relief, parent material, time)\\] The model allows for conceptual investigation of the various factors that influence the formation of a soil “system.” Jenny defined soils as “systems” that were largely influenced by initial states (relief, parent material, time) as well as their surroundings (climate, organisms). 4.1.1.2 Amundson, 2003 “Soil formation” (Amundson 2003) Key contribution: 4.1.1.3 Amundson, 2014 “Soil formation” (Amundson 2014) Key contribution: This is an extensive review on the formation of soil that extends Amundson’s earlier work in the first volume of the Treatise on Geochemistry. Structure: The chapter is structured as follows: Overview of what a “soil” is Conceptual partitioning of the earth surface Stable landforms Erosional landscapes Human dimensions of soil formation Soil chemistry in deserts Soil formation on Mars Notes: This chapter should be reviewed several times, as it is indicative of Ron’s current thinking on soil formation processes. Conceptual issue of what constitutes a “soil” - different views of soil thickness among differing scientific communities. For example: Earth sciences - primarily concerned with the mobile layer of weathering profile in which material no longer reflects parent rock (often restricts to A horizon as B horizon still has parent material) Geochemical perspectices - interested in the whole weathering process and thus interest extends to more considerable depths Import to consider: What is the depth at which I am interested for mangroves? Soil data access - There are several platforms for which rich data on soils in the US can be collected: Web soil survey - portal for soil maps and lab data Soil-web - accesses same database as Web Soil Survey, but uses a different architecture to interface with key technologies (Google Earth, Maps, &amp; smartphones) Digital soil map of the world – currently under development but needs more effort (see Sanchez, 2009, Science) Soil formation - Can very abstractly be thought of in three classes: Stable landforms, where derivative of slope = 0 Erosional landforms, where derivative of slope is negative Depositional landforms, where derivative of slope is positive Stable landforms - Depositional processes can be understood largely through examination of elements relative to that of a parent material. Often this is done by normalizing that element relative to an element that is immobile in the soil weathering environment (Zr, Ti, Nb, etc.). Often use chronosequences to examine changes over time due to inability to perform experiments over extremely long time scales. Some characteristic steps of soil formation in stable landscapes are outlined: Primary inputs to soil come from organisms; fixing of atmospheric CO2 and NO3 and NH4 bound with amino acids Biotic mechanisms take place and alter the sedimentary structure of the soil (physical mixing) Through chemical weathering, accumulation of secondary clay minerals in the B horizon occurs Clay accumulation and soil thickening occur over long timeframes, volume decreases and bulk density increases resulting in relative “collapse” of soil Whether you consider just the A or B horizon depends on discipline and particular viewpoints. Within San Joaquin Valley, the “mound and swale” topography is due to the relative increase of clay which creates a higher water table and reduces the A horizon of soil placing pressure on gophers. In response, gophers are hypothesized to undertake directional movement of soil to the tops of mounds. Note, this is the state soil of California (San Joaquin soil series) “Fine, mixed, active, thermic Abruptic Durixeralfs” Important point is that rates of mineral dissolution in almost all soils are transport limited in that it is not the resistance of elements or materials that determine rates, but rather flow of liquids. Thus, the rate of weathering is relatively constant with age and thus may have weathering fronts that exist at very considerable depths. Weathering front - the boundary between the parent rock and either weathered rock or regolith Erosional landscapes - One of the most important conceptual changes in soil formation within last fifteen years is through modeling of soil transport on hillslopes, particularly through coupling of physical processes with geochemical ones (see Dietrich et al., 2003). Denudation - processes causing wearing away of Earth’s surface via moving water, ice, wind or waves; leads to reduction in elevation and relief The chemical weathering rate can be defined as the difference between the total denudation rate and the physical erosion rate. \\[ Chemical\\ weathering = Total\\ denudation - Physical\\ erosion\\] The position of the weathering front will depend upon the relative balance between the denudatoin rate and the propagation rate of the weathering front. If denudation (soil loss) exceeds that of weathering front propagation rate, then the front cant be expected to be shallow, and vice versa. Denudation is apparently insensitive to rainfall for vegetated landscapes, where as weathering front propagation rate is highly sensitive to levels of rainfall. Human influences - The scale at which humans are influencing soils is massive. When defining “endangered soils” as those soil series that have lost at least 50% of their extent, considerable portions of soils in the US have been affected (particularly in the mid-West), but also much of the central valley and along the E. coast. The effects of mechanical alteration of soils as well as through the addition of high amounts of water in arid or semi-arid landscapes greatly accelerates chemical weathering processes (e.g., removal of salts, altering of pH, secondary clay formation, etc. Additional research is needed on the effects of agriculture on undisturbed soils. Soil geochemistry in deserts - Use of isotope research in arid soils reveals that stable isotopes in soils are rarely conservative tracers of element source (is this for all soils? what does he mean by this?), but rather reflect complex postdepositional processes caused by aqueous or gaseous transport. An important interpretation of this is that C isotope ratios of soil CO2 (and thus any carbonate that forms from it) largely reflects the isotope ratio of plant respiration and the concentration of atmospheric CO2. Additionally, C isotope ratios are highly variable along the depth profile. Soil formation on Mars - Investigation of soils in the top 10-15 cm of the surface of mars allows for interesting insight into soil formation and development processes in the absence of water; however, the conclusions of existing work conclude that much of the observation were driven by prior existence of liquids on the surface. 4.1.2 Soil classification Classifying soils includes chemical, physical, and biological properties that may be directly observable in the field or quantifiable via lab analyses. The soil taxonomic name that is associated with a particular soil series is built to reflect each of these characteristics. Key terms: Pedon - Smallest three-dimensional sampling unit that displays the full range of characteristic properties of a particular soil Polypedon - A group of closely associated pedons that are commonly found adjacent to another within the field (i.e., slight variations in a one general pedon). A polypedon forms a soil individual. Soil series - A class of soil individuals that exhibit the same properties and horizons, though they may be disjunct in space or time Diagnostic soil horizons are often associated with precise quantitative measures and are used to resolutely identify a soil as particular series or not Diagnostic soil horizons may occur at the surface or below the surface of the soil. Horizons that occur at the surface of the soil are termed epipedons. Seven epipedons exist: Mollic - Dark color rich in organic matter Umbric - Same general characteristics as mollic, but base saturation is much lower Ochric - Mineral horizon that is too thin and light in color to Mollic or Umbric; may be very hard when dry Melanic - Black, organic matter rich horizon characteristic of soils derived from volcanic ash Histic - 20 - 60 cm thick layer of organic soil materials overlaying mineral soil; characteristic of wet areas such as peats Anthropic - Same limits as Mollic epipedon, but has formed through extensive human use (e.g., agricultural soil) Plaggen - Human-made surface layer approximately 50 cm thick made from extensive manuring The diagnostic subsurface soil horizons consist of: Argillic - subsurface accumulation of high-activity silicate clays that have either precipitated downwards or formed in place Natric - silicate clay accumulation but with high exchangeable sodium on the clay complex; common in arid or semi-arid regions Kandic - accumulation of Fe and Al oxides as well as low-activity clays (kaolinite) Oxic - highly weathered subsurface horizon very high in Fe and Al, oxides and kaolinite; found in tropics and subtropics Spodic - illuvial horizon (material displaced by rainwater from one horizon to another) characterized by accumulation of colloidal organic matter and Al oxides; common in highly-leached, sandy cool humid climates (think pine forests) Sombric - illuvial horizon dark in color due to high OM accumulation; found mostly in cool, moist plateaus and mountains of tropics and subtropics Albic - light-colored eluvial (formed in place) low in clay and Fe and Al oxides which have been transported downwards Calcic - accumulation of carbonates (white chalk-like nodules) Gypsic - accumulation of gypsum Salic - accumulation of soluble salts Soil moisture regimes: Aquic - soil saturated with water Udic - moisture sufficiently high to meet plant needs Ustic - intermediate moisture between udic and aridic; significant periods of drought may occur Aridic - soil is dry for at least half of the growing season and moist for less than 90 days (torric indicates the same soils that may be hot in summer but not hot in winter) Xeric - moisture regime common to Mediterranean climates; cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers The soil temperature regimes primarily refer to: Frigid (cold) Mesic (moderate) Thermic (hot) Soil taxonomy: Order - Defined as one of 12 orders Suborder - Often integrate the moisture regime of the region (e.g., Aquent) Great group - Often indicate presence of a diagnostic horizon (e.g., Sulphaquent) Subgroup - Further define diagnostic horizon to add nuance to the classification (e.g., Halic Sulphaquent) Family - identifies subsets of subgroups that are similar in texture, mineral composition and mean soil temperature at depth of 50 cm e.g., “Typic Argiaquolls, fine, mixed, mesic, active” Typic Argiaquoll that is fine in texture, mixed clay mineral content, mesic in temperature (8 - 15 deg C), and with clays active in cation exchange Series - named after geographic feature where they were first identified There are 12 soil orders globally: Alfisols - argillic, natric or kandic horizon; high to medium base saturation (alf) Andisols - soil formed from volcanic ash (and) Aridisols - dry soils with ochric epipedon (id) Entisols - little profile development, ochric epipedon is common (ent) Gelisols - permafrost; frozen soils (el) Histosols - peatland or waterlogged soils with &gt; 20% OM (ist) Inceptisols - embryonic soil with few diagnostic features; ochric or umbric epipedon (ept) Mollisols - grassland soil rich in organic matter with mollic epipedon (oll) Oxisols - oxic horizon, highly weathered (ox) Spodosols - spodic horizon common with Fe and Al oxides (od) Ultisols - argillic or kandic horizon, low base saturation, very weathered (ult) Vertisols - high in swelling clays, cracks when dry (ert) Mangrove soils are likely to be Aquents (frequent saturation with water) or Fluvents (parent material of recent alluvium, more commonly associated with floodplains) likely to be “halic sulphaquents,” “sulfic halaquents”, or “halic sulphaquepts” Suborders commonly integrate the moisture regime of the region into the soil order (e.g., Aquent). More than 400 Great Groups exist, defined primarily by presence of diagnostic horizons, which supply formative elements for the names (suphic diagnostic horizon in Sulphaquents, halic diagnostic horizon in Halaquents) Subgroups - central concepts of a Great Group makes up one subgroup (Typic). Others introduce secondary diagnostic characteristics that better situate the soil between different Great Groups. (e.g., Sulfic Halaquents as an Aquent with Halic diagnostic properties but also Sulfuric properties). Families - Approximately 8,000 families have been identified; integrate information on the physical and chemical properties affecting the growth of plant roots. Information on particle size, mineralogy, CEC activity, temperature, and depth of soil 4.1.3 Soil architecture Soil color: Soil color is classified using the Munsell charts and is a function of: Hue - Redness or yellowness Chroma - Lightness or darkness Saturation - Intensity of brightness of the color Soil color is indicative of many properties of the soil, including presence of organic matter, moisture content, or presence of Fe or Mn oxides. Gleying refers to reduction of Fe or Fe depletion from the soil and is indicated by a gray soil color. Soil texture: Soil texture ranges greatly (e.g., from clay to boulders), but often we refer to the fine-earth fraction (sand, silt &amp; clay) in referring to soil texture. Sand - Smaller than 2 mm in size but greater than 0.05 mm; most common material constituent is quartz (SiO2), or other silicate materials Silt - Between 0.05 mm and 0.002 mm; Similar in shape and mineral composition to sand but much smaller in size and thus drains water more slowly Clay - Less than 0.002 mm; Extremely large surface areas which results in great propensity to hold water The finest sizes of clays act as colloids (i.e., where particles suspended in a liquid do not readily settle out) More commonly flat and plate-like than round which further inhibits passing of liquids and gasses Textural classes - Soils exist on a continuum of texture, but can classified generally given their relative percent composition of sand, silt or clay Central concept of a loam is defined as a mixture of sand, silt and clay that exhibits properties of those separates in approximately equal proportions. Adding peat or compost to soils does not technically change the texture, as the texture criteria is only referring to the mineral particles. Soil structure: Soil particles aggregate together to form peds or aggregates, which greatly influence the structure and functioning of the soil. Peds may vary in size from 1 mm to 1 m; Commonly used to refer to the whole structure of the soil (as aggregates exist at different scales), but is synonymous with “aggregate”. Peds often vary depending on the horizon in which they are found. The principal ped shapes are: Spheroidal Platy Prismlike Blocklike Soil aggregates consist of macroaggregates that are a combination of microaggregates. Both biological and physical-chemical processes are important in their formation, though PC processes matter primarily for microaggregates whereas biological processes are more critical for macroaggregates. Flocculation is the mutual attraction between clay and organic molecules, and is key for formation of microaggregates (particularly for sedimentation in mangroves). Form through a covalent bond in which positive charged ions compressed against one another attract negative charges on the opposites platelet. Organisms (e.g., earthworms) and plant roots are also important in forming of casts through consumption of soil as well as production of sticky substances (glomulin) that are important in forming aggregates. Soil density: There is a key distinction between particle density and bulk density that should be noted. In particular: Particle density is defined as the mass of the soil particles per unit volume of soil solids (i.e., no pore space is considered) Particle densities vary little and are typically between 2.6 - 2.75 Mg/m3 Bulk density is the mass of the soil particles per unit volume of soil (including the pore spaces) Bulk density values vary to a much larger degree One of the key reasons for measuring bulk density is for the calculation of total porosity (i.e., through comparison of particle density and bulk density). Provides a measure of total pores, but pores are comprised of both macropores (&gt; 0.08 mm) as well as micropores (&lt; 0.08 mm). Macropores readily allow movement of gas and water within the soil, as well as growth of plant roots and movements of soil organisms. “Micropores” are typically filled with water. Even when not filled with water, they are small enough to restrict passage of gasses. Water in these pores is restricted to plants 4.1.4 Soil hydrology Key notes: Properties of water molecules - Ability of water to influence soil processes is largely due to the structure of water. In particular: Polarity - The H atoms of water line up in a V-shape of 105 degrees which induces a polarity to the molecule. Hydrogen bonding - Hydrogen atom of one water molecule is attracted to the H of another water molecule forming a low-energy bond that results in polymerization of water. Hydrogen bonding thus accounts for the following behaviors of water Cohesion - Adherence of water molecules to one another Adhesion - Adherence of water molecules to the surfaces of solid particles Tension - Results from greater attraction of water molecules to one another than to gases, which results in tight bonding of water molecules at the air/water interface Capillary action is important for the movement of water within soils. Capillary action occurs through the dual action of adhesion and cohesion. Soil water energy concepts - Various forces come into play in determining movements of water in the soil. Water transfers from states of high energy to low energy, and various forces that determine the potential energy of water are important: Matric forces – forces caused by adhesion that are responsible for adsorption and capillarity. Osmostic forces – forces driven by differences in ion concentrations in solutes Gravity – self explanatory; constant downwards force on water Water potential is determined as the difference in potential energy between water within a given soil at a particular location with water at a reference location at standard pressure and temperature with no effects of soil. Total soil water potential is a function of: Gravitational potential Matric potential – extremely important for supply of water to plant roots Hydrostatic potential – pressures from the weight of water in saturated soils Osmotic potential Important for mangroves Other more minor potentials… Matric and hydrostatic potentials are part of the “pressure potential,” whereas gravitational and osmotic are considered alone. Soil water content and water potential - An inverse relationship exsists between the water content of soils and how strongly water is held within soils. In describing water content of soil, need to describe both i) the water content as well as ii) the water potential. Behavior of water in soil is typically determined primarily by water potential rather than water content. “Water content” is defined as a volume of water per volume soil. Typically measured as difference between wet and dry weights of soil. “Water potential” can be measured in different ways; Matric potential can be measured via a tensiometer, which is a semi-porous rod filled with water that allows water to flow out of the rod and creates a vacuum within the rod. Tensiometers are useful over a range of 0 to -85 kPa. Flow of water - Flow can be broken into three primary types: Saturated flows - Saturated flow occurs when soil pores are completely filled. Hydrostatic potentials play a part here and the hydraulic conductivity is largely determined by macropore spaces Flow rates are proportional to the fourth power of the radius, and thus macropore space greatly determine flows during saturated flow. Preferential flow is the faster flow of water through biopores (e.g., pores and channels created by organisms) or large cracks Unsaturated flows - Large pores are free of water but smaller pores hold water Primary driver of water flow is “matric potential gradient” Soil texture is highly important as clays will moderate flows whereas sandy loams are more “flashy” Vapor movements - Result of vapor pressure differences in relatively dry soils Infiltration and percolation - Texture of soil and in particular presence of macropores are critical here. Qualitative descriptions of soil wetness - Several classes of soil wetness can be described: Maximum retentive capacity - all pore spaces are filled, matric potential is close to zero and gravitational forces dominate Field capacity - soil will drain via gravitational forces within 1 - 3 days, and matric forces will dominate (generally a range of -10 to -30 kPa). Field capacity is an important condition given: Maximum level of water available to plants is present Soil is at optimal “pliability” in that below field capacity it will begin to crumble and above that it will easily turn to mud Sufficient pore space is available to allow aeration for microbial activity and plant growth Plant available water - from 10 - 30 kPa to 1500 kPa - water potentials at which water is largely available to plants Permanent wilting percentage - point at which plants wilt during both day and night due to inability to extract water from soil (&lt;1500 kPa) Hygroscopic coefficient - point at which water is only available in vapor form due to extreme aridity The amount of organic matter within a soil can influence the amount of plant available water greatly. Organic matter has a high water-holding capacity, particularly relative to mineral soils. “Least limiting water range” - Saturation of soil may produce anoxic conditions which restrict root growth. Often times this is the point at which only 10% of pore space is filled with air. Additionally, soils may become too dry for plant roots to push through them during growth (2000 kPa) Relevance for mangroves - My own interpretation of how this might matter for mangroves is as follows: For mangroves, matric potentials and osmotic potentials likely drive water flows within mangroves. Given the extremely find sediment of many mangrove forests, there is likely very little pore space for which water and air may enter the soil. Water flushing and aeration may only exist within top 15-20 cm of soil. 4.1.5 Soil aeration Aeration is the process of soil ventilation, with gases moving both into and out of the soil. Requires both the supply of oxygen as well as the removal of CO2 from the soil. Three primary processes control the availability of oxygen within soils: Soil macroporosity Soil water content O2 consumption Plants that have adapted to waterlogged soils (i.e., in wetlands) are hydrophytes, and have aerenchyma which are hollow tissues used for the transport of oxygen to the roots. Aeration of soil occurs through two primary mechanisms: Mass flow – much less significant on total exchange of gases Diffusion – most significant process; gases moving in response to their partial pressures partial pressures is the pressure a particular gas in a gas mixture will exert O2 will generally move into soil whereas water vapor and CO2 will typically move from soil to the atmosphere There are three primary ways of characterizing aeration of soil: Directly describing the gas constituents in the soil Air-filled soil porosity (i.e., percentage of soil pores that are filled with air) Redox potential as a measure of the oxidation and reduction of different elements (i.e., a measure of aerobic metabolism by organisms) Reduction-oxidation (redox) describes the chemical processes by which electrons are transferred. Reduction and oxidation occur together, as electron is transferred from one (the reductant) to the other (the oxidant). Micro-organisms drive majority of redox reactions, often consuming electrons from C or accepting electrons from oxygen. Respiration is largely the consumption of C based electrons from carbohydrates. Basic example of respiration in which electrons are derived from an organic molecule: \\[CH_{2}O + H_{2}O = CO_{2} + 4e^-\\] The electrons cannot exist in independent form, and thus are run through metabolic cycles in organisms and dumped onto electron acceptors (e.g., O2). Oxygen is important within soils as it rapidly accepts electrons from other elements, which allows for metabolic processes. Aerobic respiration is performed on O2 (oxidize organic carbon) and release energy for metabolic activity. The redox potential of a soil is a measure of how well much oxidation-reduction it is able to perform (i.e., a measure of its ability to accept or donate electrons), and depends upon presence of electron acceptors as well as pH. Redox potential typically decreases as the pH increases. Oxidizing soils - accept electrons easily Reducing soils - donate electrons easily Standard Eh levels for drained, well-aerated soils is in the 0.4 - 0.7 Volt range, whereas flooded conditions can reduce Eh levels to as low as -0.3 V. Other electron acceptors besides oxygen are: Nitrate - accepts 2 electrons when reduced from N(V) to N(III); reduces to N2 Manganese (VI) -&gt; reduces to Mn(II) Iron (III) -&gt; reduces to Fe(II) Sulfur (from SO42- to S2- (reduced)) Carbon (reduction of CO2 produces CH4) Electron acceptors are typically used up in this order (i.e., sulfur reduction is a process that occurs largely under very anaerobic soils). Anerobic systems result in the build up of reduced species The form of particular elements is important because it will change availability for uptake by plants (i.e., oxidized vs. reduced states). Factors that affect soil aeration: Presence of macropores – most important factor in well-drained soils; function of soil texture, bulk density, aggregate stability, OM content, and biopore formation Microbial activity – rates of respiration in the soil will greatly influence gas composition, and is dependent upon availability of organic matter Soil heterogeneity – lower oxygen concentrations in subsoils; often due to slow diffusion, reduced pore space (from compaction), and greater proportion of pore space filled by water plant roots may reduce or increase O2 content (diffusion of O2 from root aerenchyma) Seasonal differences Changes in precipitation patterns or temperature Ecological effects of soil aeration: Nature and rates of microbial activity are determined largely by O2 concentrations Redox of elements: Determines form and thus availability of elements, which may be beneficial or toxic Methane production, which occurs at Redox potentials of approximately -0.2 Activities of higher plants: Root growth may be curtailed Absorption of water and nutrients may be decreased Formation of certain inorganic compounds may occur Soil temperature Growth rates of plants are more strongly controlled by soil temperature than the air temperature. Biological zero is 5 deg Celcius, in which microbial activity virtually ceases. Impacts of frost-heave and fire on soils can be significant. Effects of fire typically limited to the top 1-2 centimeters, but can be intense enough to alter organic matter, soil conditions, and kill soil organisms. Temperature of soil in the field is largely dependent upon three factors: Net amount of heat energy the soil absorbs Heat energy required to bring change in the soil temperature The energy required for processes such as evaporation, which occur primarily near soil surface Only approximately 10% of solar incidence is actually transferred to soil. Majority is intercepted within atmosphere, by vegetation, or is loss in the evaporation of soil water. Dark soils do not necessarily warm faster than light soils due to the fact that dark soils may often be very moist and thus solar incidence is lost through evaporation of soil moisture. Thermal properties of soils The specific heat (energy required to raise the temperature of a given mass of something by 1 degree C) is much higher for water than for mineral soil solids. Thus, evaporation of water requires a very large amount of energy (2.257 MJ per kg of water). Thermal conductivity refers to the rate at which heat is tranferred through soil, and is dependent primarily on: Soil moisture content - heat passes through water much faster than through air Degree of soil compaction - heat passes through mineral particles even faster than through water, thus when compaction and particle-to-particle contact is high, heat is transferred quickly Wet compact soils are the poorest insulators (i.e., best conductors of heat) Given seasonal and daily variation in temperatures and the low thermal conductance of soils, there is a temporal lag between the soil temperature and atmospheric temperatures 4.1.6 Soil chemistry The soil colloids are arguably the most important component of soil chemistry, as they control the majority of exchange of cations and anions within the soil. The colloidal fraction of soil refers to the clays and humus particles in soil because of their extremely small size (&lt; 1 micrometer) and colloid-like behavior. The very large surface area to volume ratio of soil colloids is due to the platelike structure, and the present of internal surfaces within clays. The majority of soil colloids primarily carry more negative electrostatic charges than positive charges. Absorption of cations and anions: Colloids attract thousands of Al3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, H+, and Na+, which are loosely bound to the surface of the colloid, often in a hydrated state in moist soils. “Cation exchange” is the process in which one cation breaks free from the colloid, is released into solution, and a different cation takes its place. The ions that are readily lost from the colloid surface are referred to as “exchangeable ions”. The ionic composition of soil solution (i.e., the water) resembles that of the adsorbed ions (those bound to the colloid) due to the constant exchange between the two. Exchangeable anions are also present in the soil solution, and will exchange with soil colloids with positive charges on their surfaces. Types of soil colloids: Crystalline silicate clays – dominant in most soils; layered structure like pages in a book; predominantly negatively charged; different silicate clay minerals vary widely in particle shape, however, which influences intensity of charge, plasticity, swelling behavior, etc. Examples: smectite, vermiculite, fine mica, chlorite, kaolinite (1:1 silicate) Noncrystalline silicate clays – tithgly bonded silicon, aluminum and oxygen atoms, but do not exhibit crystalline sheets; high amounts of positive and negative charge, and capable of holding large amounts of water, but exhibit little stickiness Principle types: allophane and imogolite (both form from volcanic ash) Iron and aluminum oxides – found widely but are most important in weathered soils of sub-/tropics; slightly negative to moderately positive and are relatively low in plasticity and stickiness Examples: gibbsite (Al-oxide) and goethite (Fe-oxide) which form crystalline sheets; others are noncrystalline Organic (humus) – convoluted chains and rings of carbon atoms bonded to H, O, and N; very high capacities to hold water, but little to no plasticity and stickiness A summary of the major colloids and their properties is shown below: knitr::include_graphics(rep(&quot;images/colloids.bmp&quot;)) Layer silicate clay structure: Silicon tetrahedral and Aluminum-Magnesium octahedral sheets: Silicon tetrahedral sheets are comprised of a silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen atoms Al-Mg octahedral sheets are comprised of an Al or Mg ion surrounded by 8 oxygen-hydroxy planes Two to four of the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets will bind together by sharing some of the same oxygen atoms, which results in extremely tight bonds and forms a “layer”. The layers then are bound together via adsorbed ions and water, which forms the clay “crystal”. The nature and combination of sheets in the layers vary, and thus produce the differences in types of clays (ant thus their resultant physical and chemical properties). “Isomorphous substitution” is the process by which cations of comparable size to Si, Al, or Mg are substituted for the center of one of the tetrahedrons or octahedrons without significantly changing the structure of the crystal. This is the key process that induces variability in nature of silicate clays. Isomorphous substitution is the primary cause of charge imbalances in colloids (e.g., through the substituion of a Mg2+ for a Al3+ ion). Key difference is between 1:1 and 2:1 silicate clays: 1:1 silicate clays contain one tetrahedral and one octahedral sheet each in their layers 2:1 silicate clays contain one octahedral sheet in between two tetrahedral sheets within each layer Kaolinite is the classic example of 1:1 silicate clays. Bonding between layers (1 tetra and 1 octa) is via hydrogen bonding, which prevents expansion when the clay is wet. Cations and H2O typically do not enter the structural layers of a 1:1 mineral particle and thus effective surface of kaolinite is primarily the external surface area. Expanding 2:1 type silicate clays are formed via one octahedral sheet in between two tetrahedral sheets (e.g., smectite and vermiculite). Fine micas and chlorite, on the other hand, are relatively nonexpanding. Smectite - predominantly have negative charges resulting from isomorphous substitution. Layers are bound via an oxygen-oxygen surface and thus the bond is weak allowing for cations and water to enter the spaces in between. Vermiculite – tetrahedral sheets have large amounts of Al substitution for the silicon position, which produces a CEC higher than other silicate clays Fine-grained micas (e.g., illite and glauconite) – very weathered micas with substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ in the tetrahedral sheets. The negative charge attracts K+ ions which strengthens bond between the layers and making the fine-grained micas nonexpansive. Chlorites – Fe or Mg primarily occupies the place of Al in the octahedral sheets. Mg dominated octahedral sheets commonly sandwiched between two 2:1 layers, thus often said to have a 2:1:1 structure. Non-silicate colloids Fe and Al oxides are motified octahedral sheets with Fe or Al in the cation positions, and no tetrahedral sheets or silicon in their structures. Humus is noncrystalline and is formed of large organic molecules of varied chemical composition. Negative or positive charges on humus colloid are a result of loss or gain of H+ ions; a very large net negative charge is associated with humus, though sites of both positive and negative charges may exist Formation of colloids Humus is primarily formed through the breakdown or organic matter (mostly plant matter) by microorganisms and the resynthesis of this material into stable organic compounds. Silicate clays develop through: Physical and chemical alteration of primary minerals Decomposition of primary minerals with recrystallization of products into silicate clays Kaolinites and Fe and Al oxides are found primarily in warm, humid regions (e.g., tropics), whereas smectite, vermiculite and fine-grained micas are primarily in regions where weathering is less intense. Sources of charges on soil colloids Two major sources of charge imbalances: Hydroxyls and other functional groups on surfaces of colloids releasing or accepting H+ ions Charge imbalances as a result of isomorphous substitutions Charges of all colloids are affected to a certain degree by OH- groups, which are largely pH dependent. The charges of Al and Fe oxides, 1:1 type clays, allophane and humus are primarily determined by OH- groups. For 2:1 clays, surface charges are complemented by isomorphouos substitutions of cations. Charges from isomorphous substitution are not dependent upon pH, and thus are considered “permanent” Cation exchange reactions: Ions held to external surface of clays via electrostatic attraction, which is relatively weak and thus ions are in constant motion. There are points at which ions are closer versus slightly further away from the colloid. If an ion in soil solution enters space closer to the colloid, the ions “exchange”. Cation exchange reactions are reversible in that the cations can easily revert back to their original places. Cation exchange reactions occur on charge to charge basis (i.e., 2 H+ for 1 Ca2+). Ratios of cations within soil solution will match those of cations bound to colloids at equilibrium. “Mass action” in soil influences the direction at which reactions may occur. If cations released from a colloid precipitate, volatilize, or strongly associate with other element in the solution (e.g., the C and O atoms of a CaCO3 molecule), then they will not exchange back to the colloid. Different cations are held at different strengths to the colloid. Al3+ is held most strongly, whereas Li+ is held the weakest. The likelihood of a given cation being replaced is dependent upon the neighboring cations and the strength of bond (i.e., a Mg2+ in between 2 Al3+ ions is more likely to be replaced than Al). Cation Exchance Capacity (CEC) - Number of centimoles of positive charge that can be adsorbed per unit mass; measure is on a charge for charge rather than ion for ion basis. Measurement of CEC via pH buffered solutions will yield measures of the potential or maximum CEC, whereas measures taken at the pH of the soil will only measure the effective CEC, which corresponds to the exchangeable cations. Exchangeable cations in field soils - Varies depending on the environmental conditions of the site. In humid regions, Ca2+, Al3+, aluminum hydroxy ions and H+ are most prominent, whereas Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+ dominated in more arid regions. “Saturation percentage” refers to the percent of the exchange complex held by a particular ion. Useful in identifying acid percentage saturation (H+ and Al3+) versus nonacid (base) saturation percentage. Exchangeable cations influences the fertility of the soil, as many of the cations are common micronutrients for plants. Percent saturation of a given cation will describe its ready availability within the soil for plants to a certain degree. Anion exchange - Anions are held by colloids in two primary ways: Held by anion adsorption mechanisms similar to those of cation adsorption Reactions with surface oxides or hydroxides, which forms inner-spere complexes Positive charges associated with kaolinite surfaces attract anions such as SO42- and NO3-. Adsorption exchanges typically decrease with increasing pH for anions. Inner-sphere complexes form when an anion replaces part of a hydroxyl group that is adsorbed by a cation on a colloid. Anion exchange is important as it determines the mobility of certain important anions within the soil. 4.1.7 Soil pH Principle processes that determine soil acidification are: Production of H+ ions Washing away of cations by percolating water Both processes are facilitated by volumes of water that percolate through soil, and thus acidity is closely related to amounts of precipitation within the region. H+ ions are produced through dissociation of carbonic acid, which forms through CO2 dissolving in H2O. \\[ CO_{2}\\ +\\ H_2O\\ \\to\\ H_2CO_3\\ \\iff\\ HCO_3^{-}\\ +\\ H^+\\] Production of H^+ from H2CO3 is only significant for pH levels greater than 5. In addition, several biological processes can affect the acidity of the soil: Plant balancing of cations - when excess of certain cations are taken up by roots, H+ often released into soil solution so maintain charge balance Accumulation of OM - cations can form soluble complexes with nonacid nutrient cations (e.g., Ca2+ and Mg2+), which may result in leaching; nonacid cations may be replaced with acid cations Oxidation of nitrogen (Nitrification) - reaction of ammonium (NH4+) with oxygen releases H+ ions. Oxidation of sulfur - oxidation of sulfur yields H2SO4, which is a strong acid Alkalizing processes - Reduction of H+ or production of OH- in the soil alkalizes the soil. Several pathways of alkalizing processes exist: Weathering of nonacid cations from minerals – weathering of parent material may result in bonding of H+ and release of nonacid cations, such as Ca2+ Accumulation of nonacid cations – nonacid cations from weathering may accumulate in areas of low precipitation (Ca2+, Mh2+m K+, and Na+) Production of base-producing anions – basic, hydroxyl generating anions are carbonate (CO32-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-); these react with water to form Oh- and raise pH (important for soil buffering) The direction of carbonate reactions depends largely on the presence of CO2 in the soil, with greater amounts of CO2 acidifying the soil Excess anion uptake by roots – roots excude bicarbonate when excess of anions are taken up by roots Role of aluminum Aluminum may have a strong acidifying effect on soil, largely due to its tendency to hydrolyze (split water into H+ and OH-) ions. Pools of soil acidity - There are three major pools of acidity within soils: Active acidity - amount of H+ ion in the soil solution very small relative to other two pools determines solubility of substances and provides solution environment for organisms Exchangeable acidity - associated with exchangeable Al3+ and H+ ions present in large quantities in acid soils can be released by cation exchange with unbuffered salts and thus is sometimes referred as salt-replaceable acidity Residual acidity - hydrogen and aluminum ions bound in nonexchangeable forms by organic matter and clays will dissociate with increase in pH largest pool of acidity (10 - 100 thousand times greater than active acidity) the amount of bound hydrogen and aluminum ions is much higher for soils rich in OM and clays The relative amounts of exchangeable versus bound acid and nonacid cations within the soil is largely dependent upon pH. Exchangeable nonacid cations increases as pH increases. Percent saturation of acid vs. nonacid cations refers to the relative charge percentage accounted for by acid vs. nonacid cations. “Potential” CEC is the CEC at high pH values, whereas “effective” CEC is the CEC at the pH of the soil. Soil buffering - The ability of a soil to resists changes in pH Mechanisms of buffering are largely explained by the equilibrium between the different pools of soil acidity: active, salt replaceable and residual. Largely as a result of uptake or release of acid ions on the exchangeable complex of colloids. In general, the higher the CEC, the higher the buffering capacity of the soil. Human influences on soil acidification - Although humans may influence soil pH in many ways, three primary types exist: Nitrogen amendments - H+ is released upon oxidation of ammonium; often need to counter-balance additions of OM with additions of lime Acid precipitation - effects of acid rain due to combustion of fossil fuels addition of strong acid anions (SO42- and NO3-) will bond with nonacid cations and allow for their leaching from soil; aluminum and hydrogen then become dominant on exchange complex Exposure of potential acid sulfate soils - disturbance of soils (and thus introduction of O2) into soils with high concentrations of sulfur can produce large amounts of acidity common in wetland soils in which constant supply of sulfur is available commonly contain high amounts of pyrite (FeS2), iron monosulfides (FeS), and elemental sulfur (S) pH may be neutral but quickly shift to extremely acidic a few days after oxidation Biological toxicity - Acidic soil conditions can create toxic environments for plants and microbes: Aluminum is the most significant toxicity for plants, which is taken up in roots and restricts growth and functioning. Aluminum is only toxic at pH levels below 5.3 Manganese may also become toxic under acidic conditions as it is increasingly soluble and taken up in excess quantities. Mg is an essential micronutrient but becomes toxic in excess quantities Nutrient availability in general is greatly influenced due to varying degrees of availability that depend upon pH. Several key macronutrients may be greatly limited under acidic conditions Fungi do well across a broad range of pH values, and thus tend to dominate in acidic soils (whereas bacteria play a larger role in more neutral soils) Liming of soil - Majority of liming materials raise the pH of the soil by adding oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate that reacts with carbon dioxide and water to yield calcium (or Mg) and bicarbonate. The abundance of CO2 in soils is typically enough to drive this reaction. The calcium will exchange with acid cations on the exchangeable complex, which bind to hydroxides from the bicarbonate and thus reduces the percent acid saturation. Alternative methods to deal with acid soils - In some cases, application of liming material is not efficient (cost restrictions, acidic soil is below surface horizon, etc.) and alternative options of dealing with ill effects of soil acidity are needed: Gypsum - ameliorates aluminum toxicity without increasing soil pH Organic matter - application of organic wastes, cover crops, or mulching helps to: humified OM may bind with Al ions organic acids can form soluble complexes with Al ions that are nontoxic to plants and microbes substantial amounts of Ca may be available that can raise pH levels and also precipitate easily down the soil profile Selecting adapted plants Lowering soil pH – Acidifying soil can be done through additions or organic or inorganic acid-forming materials. Materials from trees common to spodosols (e.g., pine needles or pine sawdust) may be effective at raising the soil pH. Additionally, inorganic chemicals may be used. Saline soils - A large section exists in the chapter on saline soils, but is mostly related to agriculture and thus may not be of particular relevance here. Measuring salinity in soils: Electrical conductivity - water is a poor conductor, but salt improves its conductance; can measure conductance as an indirect measure of salinity (units: deciSiemens per meter) Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) - the degree by which the exchangeable complex is saturated with sodium. Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) - concentration of sodium relative to calcium and magnesium Classes of salt-affected soils include saline, saline-sodic and sodic. saline soils – have an ESP less than 15 or EC values greater than 4 dS/m saline-sodic soils – EC greater than 4 dS/m AND ESP greater than 15 (intermediate conditions between saline and sodic) sodic – EC less than 4 dS/m, ESP greater than 15, and SAR greater than 13 most problematic of saline soils extremely poor soil physical conditions and slow permeability of water and air Physical degradation of sodic soils can be significant, and is largely measured in terms of ready movement of water (saturated hydraulic conductivity). In some sodic soils, Ksat may be reduced almost to 0 and puddles form on the soils surface. Low permeability related to sodic conditions is due to: exchangeable sodium increases tendency of aggregates and floccules to break up when wet some expanding-type clays become highly Na+ saturated, which increases swelling capability sodic conditions may lead to soil dispersion, which is caused by: high sodium - have single charge and large hydrated size, which means they are held loosely and at far distances from soil colloids low salt concentration - low presence of ions in solution causes exchangeable ions to be spread out over greater distance and thus weakens bonds (anions are found closer to colloids) In general, low salt concentrations and weakly attracted ions encourage soil dispersion and puddling, whereas high salt concentrations and strongly associated ions (calcium) promote clay flocculation and soil permeability. 4.1.8 Soil organisms Soil organisms range from macrofauna to microfauna, and tend to aggregate in zones of favorable conditions rather than be spread out evenly through the soil. A range of different classifications for soil organisms, but often consider trophic level (primary producer, primary consumer, etc.) or feeding patterns (fungivore, herbivore, autotrophic, etc.). Primary consumers - A variety of primary consumers exist within the soil environment: herbivores - feed directly on living plant tissue, for example rodents or larvae feeding on plant roots detritivores - vast majority of soil organisms; feed on dead decaying tissues of plants on soil surface and within soil pores “shredders” - those organisms that actually feed on organisms on decaying material (e.g., bacteria) rather than the material itself; important for shredding &amp; processing of detritus saprophytic - feeding on dead tissues by fungi and bacteria (microflora); accounts for majority of decomposition of dead plant and animal debris Secondary consumers - Include microflora as well as carnivores carnivores – may include centipedes, mites, insects, nematodes, spiders, snails, etc. feed on microflora and thus are important for processing of litter Tertiary consumers - Ants, bird, or other organisms that consume the soil organisms Abundance of soil organisms: In general, the ratios of soil OM to detritus to microbial biomass to faunal biomass is 1000:100:10:1. Total living biomass is generally well-correlated with the dry-weight or organic matter, oftentimes approximately 1-5% of the dry weight of organic matter. Majority of activity in soils is by microorganisms (estimated at ~80% of total soil metabolism). Nematodes and protozoa play important roles in preying on bacteria and fungi, whereas earthworms can be significant and play an important role as ecosystem engineers. Plant roots - Typically occupy approximately 1% of soil volume and may also be responsible for 25% - 33% of the respiration occuring in the soil. Rhizosphere extends approximately 2 mm out from the root surface. Soil conditions within the rhizosphere can be significantly different from that of the surrounding soil. Fungi: Most versatile and persistent of any group of OM decomposers within soils. Extremely efficient nutrient cycling, with up to 50% incorporation into fungal tissue (vs 20% for bacteria). Thus, largely important for soil fertility. Mycorrhizae - “root fungus” or an association of certain species of fungus with plant roots that greatly expands the plants ability to take up nutrients (up to 10 times); helps provides access to nutrients that are relatively inaccessible (phosphorus) Ectomycorrhizae - primarily associated with temperate or semiarid-regions trees and plants; fungi penetrate plant roots but do not penetrate cortex cell walls (hence ecto-) Endomycorrhizae - (arbuscular mycorrhizae are most important group); penetrate cortex cell walls and form “arbuscules,” which transfer mineral nutrients to plant, and sugars from the plant to the fungus Soil prokaryotes - Bacteria and archaea; cells lack nucleus surrounded by a membrane Prokaryotes may be round, rod-shaped, or spiral; but in soils the rod-shaped prokaryotes appear to dominate. Prokaryotes have enormous diversity (handful of soil may hold as many species as fauna in the amazon), and consist of both autotrophs and heterotrophs. Perform important functions within the soil: Break down of toxins (for example archae processing hydrocarbons, i.e., oil products) Oxidation and reduction of particular elements (e.g., Iron and Mn) Nitrogen fixation Controls on soil microorganism growth: Organic matter - almost any addition of OM will boost microbial activity and growth additions of certain nutrients will prompt growth from different microorganism types for example, bacteria respond well to starch and sugars whereas fungi and actinomycetes have heavier influence with additions of cellulose or other resistant material Oxygen, moisture and temperature - increasing availability of oxygen, moisture and higher temperatures all promote microorganism activity Exchangeable cations and pH - Benefits to plants of soil organisms: Nutrient availability - primary benefit is the role in processing organic matter and increasing availability of key nutrients for plants Breakdown of toxic compounds - can breakdown and process toxins that would otherwise accumulate within the soil profile Inorganic transformations - can determine the availability of key micronutrients for plants N, S, P, Fe, Mn… May also determine the toxicity of particular elements (Se or Cr) Nitrogen fixation - fixing of N2 gas by microbes which makes it available to plants Cyanobacteria are important in wetlands and other anaerobic environments for fixing N; commonly occurs in root nodules or other associations with plants Soil organisms and damage to higher plants: Competition for nutrients Herbivory - rodents, slugs, or snails. Nematodes and insect larvae are the most damaging/extensive; fungal diseases Can control diseases or impacts on plants through management: Maintaining particular pH levels - raising or lowering the pH may be able to rid the soil of particular diseases or fungal infections Soil physical properties - allowing good structure and heating of soils can help to aerate soils or kill pathogens that may induce more significant problems 4.1.9 Soil organic matter Soil organic matter is critical to soil systems for a variety of reasons, but in particular for their increases in CEC, water holding capacity, and also importance to global carbon cycles. Inorganic carbon may also form a substantial role of C pool in the ecosystem, and is formed largely through reaction of CO2 to produce carbonic acid as well as carbonates and bicarbonates of Ca, K, Mg, and Na. Nearly half of organic carbon in soils globally is found in histosols, gelisols, and inceptisols. Process of decomposition: Dry weight plant matter is approximately 90-95% comprised of C, H, &amp; O. Four broad classes of organic compounds in plant tissue: Carbohydrates - range in complexity from simple sugars and starches to cellulose Lignins and polyphenols - difficult to decompose Proteins - contain ~16% N and decompose easily Decompositional process primarily consists of three steps: enzymatic oxidation of organic compounds - releases CO2, energy, water and biomass Nutrient specific release and/or immobilization Formation of resistant compounds either through microbial activity or modification of the compounds Mineralization - process that releases elements from organic compounds to produce inorganic forms Within a soil system, both r-strategist and k-strategist organisms exist in regards to OM decomposition. r-strategists - “rate” organisms that decompose easily digestible OM at very fast rates k-strategists - “constant” organisms that feed primarily on the more retractible OM found in the soil system With addition of OM to a system, a sharp spike in populations of r-strategists will occur, and massive amounts of decomposition will occur. As OM levels are reduced, the r-strategists begin to die-off, which provides additional nutrients for surviving r-strateigists as well as k-strategists. Eventually r-strategists die-off to quiescence. Some OM is physically protected during process, and some is left over as humus, which is a dark-colored, heterogeneous, mostly colloidal mixture of modified lignin and newly synthesized organic compounds. Oftentimes this accumulation is offset by k-strategist decomposition and thus there’s little change in OM from year to year. The factors that control rates of decomposition are primarily: Environmental conditions of the soil, for example: sufficient moisture sufficient aeration warm temperatures (25 - 35 deg C) Quality of the added residues location of the residue - soil surface vs. within the system; affects physical accessibility as well as temperature and moisture content of feedstock size of particles - surface area to volume ratios are important C:N ratio - can vary from 10:1 to 600:1 (sawdust) Nitrogen is important in all organism for synthesis of amino acids, enzymes and DNA. On average, soil microbes require a C:N ratio of 8:1 for synthesis of own organic compounds; only one third of C is assimilated into own tissues and thus they require C:N ratios of approximately 24:1. Depending on the C:N ratio of the soil, availability of N for plant communities can be greatly influenced. A nitrate depression period is when OM of high C:N is added to the soil and microbial communities use up all available N. Until microbial communities consume all OM and N and begin to die-off, N will not be available for plants. The C:N ratio will slowly decrease as CO2 is lost via respiration whereas N is kept within biomass. Consumption of microbial community by earthworms, nematodes or protozoa can result in release of NH4+ in the soil, as the macrofauna consume more N than they can consume. Genesis and nature of SOM and humus: SOM comprises of living as well as dead biomass (both recognizable and unrecognizable). The unrecognizable dead biomass is known as “humus”. Humic substances are resistant to decomposition, whereas nonhumic substances are more easily degraded. Humic substances are often ~60-80% of soil organic matter. Their complexity makes them resistant to decomposition and also induces their dark, black colors as they absorb light at many wavelengths. Nonhumic substances contain definite chemical and physical properties and thus are more readily decomposed. Influence of OM on plant growth and soils: Benefits of OM to plants occur largely indirectly, but some direct benefits exist: Uptake of N or P as soluble organic compounds Allelopathy - most allelochemicals can be included within the nonhumic OM of soil Other direct effects relate to the effect of OM on soil properties: Physical properties - humic fractions reduce plasticity &amp; stickiness of clay soils; water-infiltration is improved; nonhumic substances can improve granulation and aggregate stability Chemical properties: Humus often accounts for 50 - 90% of cation-adsorbing power of mineral surface soils Provides much of the pH buffering capacity through CEC and acid &amp; base functional groups Humic acids accelerate decomposition of soil minerals, which releases essential nutrients as exchangeable cations Biological properties: Provides food for much of the heterotrophic soil organism community Pools of organic matter: Depending on quality and availability, different “pools” of OM can be considered: Active pool - easily decomposible OM with half-lives of days to a few years (~10-20% of OM) e.g., living biomass, pieces of detritus, most of polysaccharides, other nonhumic substances Can be readily enhanced through additions, but is also readily lost Slow pool - finest fractions of particulate OM that is high in lignin, as well as other slowly decomposable or chemically resistant components Passive pool - primarily material protected within clay-humus complexes; remains in soil for hundreds to thousands of years (~60-90% of OM) closely associated with colloidal properties of soil and thus most responsible for CEC and water holding capabilities Other: Contributions to OM by plants in grasslands is often higher and more efficient than forests, given grasses greater biomass contribution roots and their greater resistance to decay. This is interesting in that mangroves might have more significant root biomass than previously believed and thus the contributions from root biomass to SOC may be significant. Methane emissions - methane emissions from salt wetlands are much lower than freshwater emissions, largely because levels of sulfate in sea water allow for sulfur-reducing prokaryotes to out-compete methanogens for organic matter within the ecosystem. 4.1.10 Soil nutrients **Key notes:** Nitrogen is in general the most widely occurring nutritional limit on plant growth globally. Phosphorus is generally the second most widespread nutritional limit. Nitrogen - A major part of all proteins, nucleic acids, chlorophyll, etc. Plants take up N as nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4+). Atmospheric N2 is abundant, but is not directly available given strong triple bond between N atoms. Microbial fixation or lightning is required to break the triple bond and make N available for plants. Ammonium and nitrates account for the most important forms of inorganic N in the soil environment. Majority of N is found within soil OM, which is typically approximately 5% N. N in ammonium is subject to five different fates: Immobilization - occurs via microoganisms Removal - uptake by plants Fixation - can be fixed within the layers of certain 2:1 clay minerals Volatilization - emission to atmosphere after being transformed into ammonia gas Nitrification - process in which is is oxidized to nitrite and subsequently to nitrate N in nitrate is subject to five fates, some of which overlap: Immobilization – occurs via microorganisms Removal - uptake by plants Leaching - loss to groundwater via percolation Volatilization - loss to atmosphere as several N-containing gases formed by denitrification Conversion to ammonium - dissimilatory (nitrate) reduction to NDRA by anaerobic organisms Immobilization and mineralization Much of N is protected in OM, but is eventually released as NH4+ through decomposition (mineralization). Conversion of inorganic N to biological forms is termed immobilization, and is the opposite process of mineralization. May take place through either biological or nonbiological processes. biological pathway occurs when microorganisms consume OM high in C relative to N, and thus scavenge nitrates and ammonium to account for deficiency from the soil; often removes mineral N from the soil (nitrogen depression period) abiotic pathway is through rapid chemical reactions with high C/N ratio soil OM Soluble organic N compounds are available for plant uptake and leaching losses; however the chemical constituents of SON are poorly known at present. Ammonium fixation by clays Ammonium are attracted to negative surfaces of clays and humus, where they’re held in exchangeable forms &amp; are available for plant uptake. May become more permanently fixed in pockets within the crystalline structure of particular 2:1 clay types. Although this can help preserve mineral N in the soil environment, it may also not be available to plants at rates at which it is needed. Ammonia volatilization Volatilization is conversion of NH4+ to NH3+ by reaction of ammonium with OH-. Given the dependence of the reaction on OH-, ammonia volatilization is much greater in soils of higher pH. Ammonia volatilization in wetland soils can be quite significant, particularly during warm days when warm weather promotes photosynthetic algae consumption of dissolved CO2 and thus loss of carbonic acid results in increase in pH. Nitrification Conversion of ammonium to nitrates in a two-step reaction (NH4+ to NO2- to NO3-). When ammonium is released into the soil, it is commonly rapidly converted to nitrate. Nitrification may be reversed be several bacterial processes, some of which occur in anaerobic environments: denitrification - heterotrophic bacteria reduce nitrate to NO, N2O or N2 gases dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) - reduces NO3- to NO2- and then to NH4+ Nitrate leaching Nitrates readily move downwards with free water and thus are easily leached from the soil. This can result in toxicity problems for humans, livestock or other ecosystems if there is a large build up of nitrates. Gaseous loss by denitrification Denitrification of nitrates may produce NO, N2O and N2. NO (nitric oxide) and N2O (nitrous oxide) can be particularly environmentally damaging in at least four ways: Form nitric acid, which is one of the principle components of acid rain May react with volatile organic pollutants to form ground-level ozone Very potent (but shortlived) greenhouse gases N2O destructs ozone May be extremely high in wetlands due to periods of wetting (denitrification) and drying (nitrates produced). May be seen as an ecosystem service of natural wetlands in that they protect estuaries and lakes from eutrophication Biological N fixation Conversion of atmospheric N2 to forms usable by organisms by limited number of bacteria (rhizobium, actinomycetes, cyanobacteria). Key component is the enzyme nitrogenase, which catalyzes reduction of N2 to NH3+. The ammonia is then used to form amino acids and subsequently proteins. Nitrogenase is destroyed by O2, and thus the enzyme needs to be protected from exposure to O2. The molecule that protects nitrogenase (leghemoglobin) is virtually the same as hemoglobin that gives blood red color when oxygenated, hence root nodules on legumes are red. Additionally, fixation of N2 is very energy intensive, and thus mutual relationships between N-fixing bacteria and plants occur. Host plant supplies bacteria with carbohydrates as energy sources, whereas bacteria provide the plant with reactive-nitrogen compounds. Sulfur Important as key constituent of essential amino acids, vitamins, enzymes &amp; aromatic oils. Sulfur has three primary “natural” sources: Organic matter - microorganisms break down organic sulfur compounds to soluble forms analogous to release of ammonium and nitrate Soil minerals - inorganic forms are primarily sulfates and sulfides. Sulfates directly available to plants whereas sulfides must be oxidized to sulfate form before they may be taken up by plants Sulfur gases in the atmosphere - primarily COS, H2S, and SO2 are produced from volcanos, ocean spray, biomass fires and fossil fuel burning. These are eventually oxidized to sulfates which form sulfuric acid and result in acid rain. Sulfur cycle – There are four major forms of S that occur: Sulfides Sulfates Organic sulfur Elemental sulfur Similar to N cycle, atmosphere is an important source and much of the S in the system is held within organic matter, which is subject to microbial oxidation and reduction. For systems in which S uptaken by plants is eventually returned to the soil, the above three sources are typically sufficient. In agricultural systems in which biomass is removed, significant deficiencies in S may occur. Sulfur cycle Mineralization - Largely occurs through same pathway as N. Organic sulfur is decomposed and sulfates are released into the soil. Immobilization - occurs when low-sulfur, C-rich organic forms are added; microbes will scavenge for mineral S to facilitate uptake of organic matter; temporary in that the inorganic sulfate will reappear in soil solution Sulfur oxidation and reduction Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is produced through oxidation of H2S or S, which occurs at a wide range of soil conditions. Sulfate ions tend to be unstable within anaerobic environments, and are reduced to sulfide ions by bacteria in two genera. THe sulfide ion will react almost immediately with reduced soluble Fe or Mn to form insoluble sulfides in anaerobic soils. Sulfide ions also undergo hydrolysis to form gaseous hydrogen sulfide, which gives swamps rotten-egg smell. Phosphorus - Critical for ATP, DNA and RNA Phosphorus is generally unavailable in soils due to three reasons: Total concentrations are typically low Compounds in soil often unavailable for plant uptake due to insolubility Soluble sources of P (fertilizers, etc.) are often fixed upon addition to soil Phosphorus cycle Plants absorb P typically as phosphate ions that are dissolved in soil solution. The P typically is slow moving within the soil system, and thus growth of roots or mycorrhizal connections are important in facilitating uptake of P Decomposition of OM - microorganisms temporaily hold P as part of biomass, but will eventually release it through mineralization; portions of it will enter active and passive fractions of soil OM Chemical forms - little P is lost due to volatilization or leaching, but rather limits of P are due to insolubility and fixation that makes it functionally unavailable. Primarily three general groups of compounds: organic phosphorus calcium-bound inorganic phosphorus - stable and insoluble at high pHs, more soluble at low pH Fe- or Al-bound inorganic phosphorus - opposite solubility of Ca-bound P Gains and losses - losses are primarily due to biomass removal, erosion of P-bound soil particles, or P dissolved in surface runoff or leaching to groundwater; primary additions are through atmosphere, which is often sufficient in natural environments P availability Generally 20-80% of P is held in OM in soil systems. For inorganic P, two primary controls on its availability exist: i) solubility of P-containing minerals, and ii) fixation or adsorption of P ions on surface of soil particles. Phosphorus can precipitate with Fe, Al or Mn ions, which forms insoluble hydroxy phosphate precipitates. In very acidic soils, enough Al, Fe, or Mn typically present to precipitate all dissolved H2PO4- ions. Fixation of inorganic P with Fe- and Al- oxides and also 1:1 clays can be large given their large presence within many soils. Can fix P over very long term by additional precipitation of other Fe- and Al- oxides on top of the oxide bound P (termed “occluded” Phosphorus). Iron reduction under wet conditions - anaerobic conditions can reduce Fe in complexes from Fe3+ to Fe2+, which makes the iron-phosphate complex more soluble and allows release of phosphorus into solution. Big take-away is that P is generally present but is not available and thus there are high P limitations. Potassium Only present in soil solution as cation, and behavior in soil is thus largely effected soil cation exchange properties and mineral weathering. Key role in organisms is as an activator of particular enzymes. Important in metabolic processes in mangroves and important in balancing Na+ levels. Potassium cycle Majority of K+ is in primary minerals and nonexchangeable forms. May be fixed within 2:1 clays, but overtime will become available through the exchangeable complex. Potassium is susceptible to leaching, but some plants with deep roots may mine K+ and act as “nutrient pumps” in that they move K+ to leaves and then return it to the soil surface upon loss of leaves. Plants take up large quantities of K+. Potassium availability Three factors shape availability of K+ within a soil system: Small proportion readily available - Total presence of K+ is high, but the amount available through exchangeable complex at any given time may be quite small. Leaching losses - quite susceptible to leaching (more than P, less than N); somewhat moderated by attraction of positive charge to negative surfaces of clays and humus Luxury consumption - removal by plants is high, even without proportional increases in growth Total amount of K+ available is largely a function of the kinds of clays present in a soil. Soils with 2:1 clays typically have more potassium whereas those with kaolinite tend to have the least. Calcium Calcium is a major component of cell walls, as well as cell elongation and division, membrane permeability, and activation of enzymes. Deficiencies of calcium for plants is rare, except in acid soils. Calcium is found primarily in three pools within the soil system: Ca contianing minerals Ca complexed with soil humus Ca held by CEC on clay and humus colloids Much of Ca source within a soil system is through dry deposition (i.e., coal burning or wind erosion of calcareous desert soils) Magnesium Intimately involved with photosynthesis, and is taken up in relatively small quantities by plants. Primary source of Mg is the exchangeable Mg on colloidal clay-humus complex, which is replaced by mineral weathering following depletion by leaching or plant uptake. Micronutrients For macronutrients, the range at which nutrients can be uptaken and be used without being toxic is quite large. For micronutrients the range is quite narrow, however, and thus particular elements can become toxic for plant growth. Micronutrients play a variety of roles in plants, though many are involved in enzyme systems. Different micronutrients are needed in different concentrations in plants. Common micronutrients: Fe, Mn, Zn, B, Cu, Mo, Ni Availability of micronutrients Inavailability of micronutrients may be due to lack of total concentration in soil, but is more commonly a result of unavailability of the particular nutrient. Chemical forms of the various nutrients are important (e.g., oxides) Factors that affect the availability of micronutrient cations include: soil pH - increases in soil pH result in decrease in availability of micronutrient cations as they move to hydroxy ion forms and subsequently to hydroxide or oxide forms (insoluble) general desirability of mildly acidic soil is to promote availability of micronutrients oxidation state and pH - interaction of soil acidity and drainage important in determining micronutrient availability; Fe, Mn, and Cu generally more available in flooded soils organic matter - decomposition of OM can result in slow release of micronutrients; additionally, binding of micronutrients to OM can protect micronutrients from binding to mineral complexes which makes them relatively more insoluble than when bound with OM mycorrhizae – can be important in facilitating uptake of micronutrients References "],
["geomorphology-soils.html", "4.2 Geomorphology", " 4.2 Geomorphology 4.2.1 Thom, 1967 “Mangrove ecology and deltaic geomorphology: Tabasco, Mexico” (Thom 1967) A full summary of Thom, 1967 is provided in the “Zonation and Disturbance section.” Please refer to Section 3.1.2. From a geomorphological standpoint, this is one of the most well-cited studies arguing that mangrove vegetation patterns respond primarily to the hydrological and sedimentary conditions that exist within a given site. 4.2.2 Carlton, 1974 “Land building and stabilization of mangroves” (Carlton 1974) Key contribution: This is a perhaps less seminal paper but provides a brief review of the literature surrounding the ability of mangroves to “build” and “stabilize” shorelines. Much of the reviewed work is from Florida. Key conclusions: Carlton concludes more or less that mangroves do not “build” land per se, but are influential upon the rate at which sediments accrete on shorelines. In sum, two viewpoints exist: mangroves “build” land by accretion of sediments (a la Davis 1940) (UNSUPPORTED) mangroves modify the rate at which sediments accrete, thus affecting the speed of geomorphic change rather than the direction (Egler 1952, Gill 1971) (SUPPORTED) Further reading: Egler 1952 Gill 1971 4.2.3 Thom, 1982 “Mangrove ecology: A geomorphological perspective” (Thom 1982) Key contribution: This study is best known for the five environmental settings that Thom lays out for clastic (terrigenous) sediment deposition. The five environmental settings are detailed below: River dominated - Deltaic or estuarine settings in which significant sediment is transported from alluvial flows to the coastal region. The landscape is marked by numerous distributaries and interdistributary basins that vary in hydrology, particularly in regards to tidal influence. Tide dominated - Estuarine type settings in which the dominant hydrology is the bidirectional flow of tides. Often see sandy shoals within the estuary that are shaped parallel to the flow of tides. Wave dominated - Environmental settings in which flat shorelines accumulate sand barriers or cheniers that create lagoons and create regions of low-energy coastlines in which mangroves may establish. Sediment is primarily autochthonous. River &amp; wave composite - Settings in which both deltaic plains with strong alluvial influence as well as strong wave influences create a complex of alluvial fans and lagoons blocked by wave-distributed sand barriers from longshore flows. E.g., Tabasco, Mexico. Drowned river valleys - Estuaries or embayments that are underlain by impervious rock and have been flooded during the most recent period of sea level rise. Key knowledge: Thom describes the geomorphology of mangrove from three standpoints: Geophysical - The dominant physical processes that affect a landscape, such as SLR or climate Geomorphic - The dynamic history of the land in response to the dominant geophysical factors. Can be broken into three scales: macro: clastic vs. carbonate sediments meso: dominant physical process (tide vs. riverine vs. wave) micro: microtopographic features such as drainage and elevation that produce environmental gradients Biological - Factors such as biogeography or competition that affect the landscape Additionally, Thom notes that his five suggested geomorphig settings are not comprehensive but are rather representative of dominant processes that may be relevant. Thom goes on to discuss variations and scale in time and space and their resultant effects on mangrove geomorphology. He concludes that zonation of mangrove species responds opportunistically to geomorphic setting, and areas with high geomorphic diversity will have high degrees of habitat variation. Topics to think about further: How do geomorphic settings related to soil texture and soil carbon? 4.2.4 Woodroffe, 1983 “Development of mangrove forests from a geological perspective” (Woodroffe 1983) Key contribution: This paper describes the development of an autochthnous, geomorphically inactive mangrove forests on Grand Cayman island. The study takes a geological perspective in that they examine soil depths and soil cores throughout the west peninsula, and reconstruct models of autochthonous development of the mangrove forest through time. Key findings: The study concludes that there were key tidal inlets which were eventually breached my rising sea levels and allowed for expanded colonization of the calcerous bedrock by mangroves. Soil depths &amp; cores indicate that there was a forest of landlocked mangroves at one point during low-levels (200 cm below present), but the authors are unsure of how tidal fluxes reached this area. 4.2.5 Thom, 1984 “Coastal landforms and geomorphic processes” (Thom 1984) Key contribution: This is an extension of (Thom 1982), in which Thom describes three carbonate settings. The conclusions are largely the same as (Thom 1982), and thus refer to section 4.2.3 for them. Key additions: The carbonate settings that Thom adds to his original five clastic settings are as follows: Carbonate platform - Accumulation of lime muds and peat on low-energy tropical coasts. Oftentimes the fringing mangroves are against large, open, shallow bodies of water. Coral reef or sand barriers may block wave and tidal energy to produce low-energy conditions Sand/shingle barrier - Mangroves may form on the cemented or non-cemented coral detritus, for example patchy mangroves colozining portions of the Great Barrier Reef. Sand mostly consists of carbonate particles and sea levels play an important part on depositional characteristics Carbonate embayments - Embayments in which soil “crusts” were submerged by SLR during Holocene. E.g., patchy mangroves on old reef complexes that are highly variable and reflect varability in the substrate complexity. Key knowledge: In addition, Thom discusses some of the prior models of succession and zonation in mangroves. In particular he identifies three trends of research, including one in which he situates himself: “Classical succesional view of mangroves” - The “Davis 1940” view of mangroves that emphasizes the role of biota rather than geophysical or geomorphological processes “Environmental gradient view” - The more “ecological niche” based view of vegetation patterning that results from environmental gradients; Watson 1928 was one of first studies to argue for this effect “Physiographic ecology” - regards physical and botanical landscapes as mosaics of landforms that result from differential effects of physical processes on different materials, and the promotion of different biological communities in response to them focused at landscape scale, geomorphic variety produces variety in biological assemblages Other reading: Snedaker, 1982 - Mangrove species zonation: Why? 4.2.6 Woodroffe, 1990 “The impact of sea-level rise on mangrove shorelines” (Woodroffe 1990) Key contribution: This review by Woodroffe discusses the impacts of relative sea level rise as it was projected at the time on mangroves. There has since been 27 years worth of research in this topic, and thus it’s important to couple this study with more recent papers. Crux of the issue - “order of rates of sea-level rise that have been predicted would in some cases lead to major disruption of mangrove forests” Key notes: ability of mangrove forests to respond to different levels of sea level rise depends on coastal morphology steep cliffs (e.g., mid-oceanic atolls) may not be able to respond due to lack of ability to migrate along shoreline as well as distant propagule sources for recolonization Eustatic patterns during Holocene have varied regionally in Indian and Pacific Oceans, rose to approximately 1-2 m above present levels, before falling and stabilizing at current levels in West Indies and Southern US, increasingly risen though at decelerating rates to arrive at period of stability of today mangroves are effective indicators of past sea-level if species with given preference for position in intertidal zone can be identified within paleosedimenets however, often not clear because of compaction and contamination with younger aged organic matter given sea level rise, the ability of mangrove forests to persist may be largely dependent upon the catchment size of deltas (i.e., size of area from which water and sediments drain) carbonate settings are at higher risk of undergoing regime shifts relative to deltaic or estuarine mangroves Woodroffe combines Thom’s environmental settings into three primary classes of geomorphological development: river dominated tide dominated carbonate He expounds on them in this article, whereas he summarizes them in his review in Tropical Mangrove Ecosystems (see Section @(woodroffe1992)). 4.2.7 Woodroffe, 1992 “Mangrove sediments and geomorphology” (Woodroffe 1992) Key contribution: This is a key synthesis of knowledge related to geomorphology and environmental settings in mangroves. Woodroffe gives an overview of sedimentation and shoreline progradation / erosion, followed by a review of Thom’s environmental settings and Lugo and Snedaker’s mangrove habitats. He concludes the article with a review of stratigraphy and paleoecology, with particular reference to mangrove responses to relative sea level rise. Key findings: For Thom’s clastic environmental settings, refer to Section 4.2.3 For Thom’s carbonate environmental settings, refer to Section 4.2.5 For Lugo and Snedaker’s functional habitats, refer to Section 3.1.3 Diagrams of Thom’s environmental settings are provided below: Stratigraphy and paleoecology: Quaternary period (~past two million years) comprised of: Holocene (~11,700 YBP) sea level has been approximately stable for 6,000 years sea level was rising rapidly from approximately 10,000 - 6,000 YBP though there is likely regional variation Pleistocene (~2.5 mil to 11,700 YBP) Sediments deposited during Holocene are well preserved and contain structures &amp; fossils that are useful, whereas sediments deposited during Pleistocene are less well preserved sea level rise on more gradually sloping coasts likely resulted in significant fluctuation of mangrove forests, whereas carbonate atolls (e.g., on coral) likely disappeared during high sea levels or were restablished during low sea levels transgression - landward movement of shoreline during periods of sea level rise regression - seaward movement of shoreline during periods of sea level subsidence there are also iteractions with progradation and erosion that may reverse processes at specific locations Woodroffe examines three patterns of tropical geomorphological development: tropical deltas that are river dominated (poorly studied as of 1992) estuarine embayments that are tide-dominated Progradational model - estuary shoreline gradually build into estuary and is generally fringed by mangroves Big swamp model - rapid accumulation of sediment as sea level stabilizes followed by vertical accretion and conversion to other types; differs from progradational model in that there’s little age difference between mangrove sediments Barrier estuary/mud basin - sand reworked from seward shelf and forms sandy barrier or flood tidal delta; lagoon is sink for fluvial sand and mud from terrestrial sources by rivers carbonate banks or reefs predominantly characterized by in situ production of sediments Note: This is a key study that would be good to review again later. 4.2.8 McKee, 2007 “Caribbean mangroves adjust to rising sea level through biotic controls on change in soil elevation” (McKee, Cahoon, and Feller 2007) Key contribution: This is a very well-cited study that experimentally examples biological controls on soil elevation in mangroves of the Meso American Barrier Reef (in Belize). Study design: The authors installed elevation rods with rod surface elevation tables (RSETs) that were able to measure changes in elevation from a baseline over the course of three years in fringe, transition and interior mangroves. They examined the effects of nutrient additions (N, P &amp; a control) across three transects at three replicate sites. In addition, they laid a sand horizon in a plot adjacent to the RSETs and used cores to monitor subsurface accretion, allowing for differentiation between subsurface accretion and surface accretion of biomass to elevation. Finally, the authors examine several cores (up to 10m in depth) across sites throughout the Caribbean to examine relative SLR and mean soil accretion. Key results: The authors conclude that the fringe portion of the forests are able to keep pace with sea level rise, primarily due to subsurface accumulation of biomass (significantly correlated with elevation change). The fringe zone was found to have significantly positive gain in elevation, with majority from subsurface change, whereas interior and transition zones saw subsidence. Elevation gains were seen across all sites for P addition, whereas elevation gain was variable in directino for N (negative in interior). The authors give three key points: Rates of modern change in elevation may vary in both direction and magnitude within forests Elevation changes vary in relation to physico-chemical gradients that may control natural productivity of mangroves Elevation changes due to variation in nutrients are variable in both direction and magnitude The key results in elevation change across treatments are shown below: The results from the mangrove peat cores showed that peat accumulation corresponded with rates of SLR over the past 6,000-7,000 years. Although they are currently keeping pace with sea level rise, the cores show that at points (in which SLR exceeded 5 mm / yr), mangroves were lost from the area. Thus, the presence of mangroves at these sites depends on relative SLR rates (eustatic rise plus local subsidence). Rates of mangrove peat accretion, however, may underestimate ability to respond to SLR as these are often based on mean rates from historical records that likely fluctuate significantly in response to SLR. 4.2.9 Woodroffe, 2016 “Mangrove sedimentation and response to relative sea level rise” (Woodroffe et al. 2016) Key contribution: This study is a review of sedimentary processes and geomorphology with a particular focus on their responses to relative sea level rise. The study introduces the concept of the accomodation space in the context of mangroves, which is the space available for potential sediment accumulation. Notes: Considering processes at different scales: Macroscale - processes at the landscape level (environmental setting a la Thom) Climate, eustatics Mesoscale - habitat level (fringe, basin, etc. a la Lugo and Snedaker) Hydrodynamics, sediment supply (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) Microscale - individual tree or plot level Interactions between surface elevation, geomorphic processes (accretion vs. compaction), and biological processes (BGB production) A nice summary of interactions between sedimentology, hydrology and biology: “The distribution of mangrove species coincides with the intertidal accomodation space, which progressively fills through sediment accumulation. Emergent properties and biocomplexity are a function of hydroperiod and are related to salinity and flooding tolerance, the latter of which is related to root morphologies, physiology, and reproductive traits such as vivipary.” Accomodation space - the space available for potential sediment accumulation. Typically see highest accomodation space at shoreline in mangroves, though it may be highly variable (e.g., basin areas that are only flooded during highest tides). may distinguish between mineral vs. biological accretion, and thus may consider “ecological accomodation space” Rates of sedimentation depend upon the accomodation space, which depends on hydrology and other factors. In the short term, the rate of sediment deposition appears independent of rate of SLR. The accomodation space is directly constrained by upper limit of tidal flooding. Focusing on vertical adjustment within a mangrove forests risks missing broader regional picture in that mangroves have constantly shifted position throughout time, and thus there may be natural fluctuations with sea level rise that can maintain existence as well as are potentially key climate change mitigation opportunities.

How do rivers influence the growth of mangroves? There is a lot of mathematical hydrological modeling that is over my head in this study, but there are some relevant ecological points that are worth noting. Key results: Some key results from the study include: The “trapping mechanism” is the dominant parameter controlling “longitudinal dispersion” in their study swamp. They conclude that it is likely the dominant mechanism in many swamps in the absence of large buoyancy effects (i.e., dry seasons) Buoyancy effects are important due to trapping of freshwater in the swamp at high tide and boundary layer that enters the river banks at low tide Residence time of runoff in mangrove swamps may be quite long with important ecological implications, such as nutrient uptake and settling of fine sediments A diagram of the “trapping mechanism” of fresh water in the landward portion of swamps is shown below: Further reading: This study led to some questions that may be important for understanding soil formation in mangroves. In particular: What is the “trapping mechanism” in estuarine hydrodynamics? What are the specific processes of tidal mixing and what is the broader relevance for the ecology of mangroves? What is longitudinal dispersion in relation to mangroves? What are the specific implications of buoyancy effects, and how do they vary between dry and wet seasons? 4.3.2 Wolanski et al, 1992 “Mangrove hydrodynamics” (In Robertson and Alongi, 1992) (Wolanski, Mazda, and Ridd 1993) Key contribution: This is a comprehensive review of hydrodynamics in mangroves, that comes from the Robertson and Alongi book. Key notes: Of the 5 (6) different Lugo and Snedaker geomorphic setting classifications, hydrodynamics in the riverine forest type has been studied the most extensively. Tidal circulation - Tidal circulation is often the dominant cause of water movement. Ebb tides are shorter than flood tides, but have slightly stronger water flows. Water movements within tidal creeks are frequently greater than 1 m/s, however water flows within the forest itself are rarely greater than 0.1 m/s. Mathematical models of hydrodynamics in mangroves have largely focused on two components: Tidal creeks - where acceleration, sea level gradients, friction and inertia are all important Forest flood - where inertial effects can largely be neglected Tidal assymetry - Currents in tidal creeks are strong during ebb flow relative to flood flow. The key to understanding this is that friction within the bed of the creek as well as the forest floor produces a time lag between the time of high tide at the head of the creek, versus the time of high tide at the mouth of the creek. The higher water level at the head of the creek accelerates flows back towards the mouth of the estuary. The stronger ebb flow relative to the flood flow is important in maintaining channels and also export of suspended matter from the mangrove; reductions in forest extent will impact ebb flow as the difference in water height between shoreward and landward zones is a function of the distance and is greatly reduced. The creek will then silt rapidly until balance is reachieved in which scouring action can reoccur. Exchange with the nearshore zone - The presence of salinity within any given location in the forest and the intermixing of coastal, tidal and freshwater flows depends on the tide, season and relative amount of each within the system. Bounds between freshwater and saline water may exist in the uppertidal reaches following a flushing of the estuary by freshwater (e.g., heavy rain event and low tide), which is produced by influx of high tide and limited mixing with the freshwater. May take several weeks for freshwater to be flushed from the system. Transverse circulation - Secondary circulation phenomena exist due to primary tidal circulation and net downstream transport of freshwater. Longitudinal circulation - caused by saltwater inflow at creek bottom and freshwater flow at surface from density effects. Transverse flows produce linear aggregations of leaf litter and propagules and, though understudied, are likely formed through similar processes as linear oceanographic features near coral reefs. Tidal currents and sediment fluxes - At the time of this article, there were key knowledge gaps in reference to tidal currents and sediment fluxes. See the Fukukara pieces for more precise information on sedimentation rates within the forest (Sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4). In general, flow rates are not sufficient to reentrain sediment in the water column, particularly during flood tides. This provides support of the importance of ebb flows in scouring process for maintaining channel depths. Groundwater flow - Flows of groundwater are important but are poorly understood. During initial flooding of forest floor, water may first be seen through bubbling out of crab holes which is an important mechanism for maintaining lower salt concentrations. Climatic and tidal influences - Amount and periodicity of precipitation greatly influence the hydrodynamics of a given site. Balance between rainfall and evaporation, when coupled with tidal variations, is a key factor that determines salinity status of various portions of the mangrove. A diagram of physical, biological and chemical processes as they relate to mangrove hydrology is shown below: 4.3.3 Furukawa, 1996 “Sedimentation in mangrove forests” (Furukawa and Wolanski 1996) Key significance: Furukawa and Wolanski show through an empirical study that a sediment pump from coastal waters to the mangrove interior does exist. They find that the presence of a tidal pump is largely due to: High turbulence that maintains entrainment of fine sediments during flood tide. Settlement of flocculated sediment during slack high tide in which turbulence is reduced, and increased flocculation which results in order of magnitude increase in size. Insufficient ebb tide velocities to resuspend settled sediment (of now larger size). Key notes: Water velocity of tidal flooding in a mangrove forest can be described as: \\[ u = 1/n\\ *\\ h^{2/3}\\ *\\ I^{1/2} \\] Where: u: water velocity n: Mannings friction coefficient h: water depth I: water surface slope Typical values for the Mannings friction coefficient for sandy channels are in the range of 0.025-0.035, whereas empirical studies by Wolanski have found values as high as 0.2 - 0.4 for areas with mangrove vegetation. Thus, mangrove vegetation increases the Mannings friction coefficient by several orders of magnitude. This results in a failure to resuspend fine sediments that are deposited during slack high tide and thus promotes build-up of sediment. Consideration of floc size is important for sedimentation studies within mangroves. In calculating the settling velocity (via Stoke’s law) for both individual particles of clay and silt, as well as that of mean floc size measured within the tidal water, settlement of flocs was found to be approximately 100 times larger than for individual particles (0.005 m/s). Empirical measurements in the field showed that for tree species with complex matrices of aboveground roots, turbulence was intense enough to maintain flocs in suspension. For single stemmed trees without root systems (e.g., Bruguiera or Ceriops), both turbulence and flow velocity are reduced. 4.3.4 Furukawa, 1997 “Currents and sediment transport in mangrove forests” (Furukawa, Wolanski, and Mueller 1997) Key contribution: A sister study to (Furukawa and Wolanski 1996), this study describes the empirical data collected to investigate current flows and suspended sediment characteristics of a mangrove in Australia. Research design: Water level, currents, sedimentation (via sediment traps and Analite nephelometers (upward looking cameras)), suspended sediment levels (via water samples), and concentration of flocs (via microscopic slides with wells) were measured along a transect in the forest, at varying distances from a tidal creek. The data were compared against three hydrological models to investigate the accuracy of mathematical modelling of hydrodynamics and sedimentation in mangroves, as well as analyze the empirical data for the site. The models were: 2DSWAMP - flow model based on primitive equations of motion LAKE - a lake model that assumes flat water surface and determines flow rate VORTEX - a discrete vortex model that provides information on turbulence Key findings: The LAKE model performed poorly and was not used within in the subsequent analyses (unrealistic assumption that the surface water is flat). Suspended sediment concentration showed strong asymmetry in that concentration was higher at flood tibe and much lower at ebb tide. This is indicative of net inwelling of sediment into the mangrove. Sedimentation rates decreased with distance from the tidal creek. In calculating the sedimentation velocity, the median floc size (90 micrometers) was approximately 4 times that of size of solid minerals (24 micrometers) given high porosity of flocs. Visual investigation of suspended sediment reveals that much of the flocs had settled out of the water column following slack high tide. Vegetation greatly increased turbulence and created a complex set of hydrological effects (eddies, stagnant regions, and jets). DOC was found to vary inversely with tidal depth, with the lowest DOC concentration present during slack high tide. Furthermore DOC in the forest was found to be greater than coastal waters, indicating that both creek and mangrove waters are significant sources of DOC. The findings suggest a net inwelling of DOC in the forest (greater DOC concentration during flood tide than ebb tide), but this does not corroborate with other analyses. 4.3.5 Krauss et al, 2003 “Differential rates of vertical accretion and elevation change among aerial root types in Micronesian mangrove forests” (Krauss, Allen, and Cahoon 2003) Key contribution: Understanding of sedimentation and hydrology in mangroves has largely been theoretical and model based, and thus this study represents one of the only studies to investigate the differential effects of different root morphologies on sedimentation in mangroves empirically. Study design: Rates of sediment accretion and elevation change for three different root types were examined in three different river basins in the Federated States of Micronesia. Experimental plots of 25 m in radius were established within the fringe, riverine and interior sections of each of the river basins, and three 1 m2 plots were established in the plots in each of the three root types (Rhizophora prop; Avicennia pneumatophore; and Bruguiera knee) as well as a control. Marker horizons (50% feldspar clay, 50% sand) were laid and 5 100 cm pins were inserted 70 cms into the soil to estimate sediment accretion and surface elevation changes, respectively. Additionally, root basal areas were calculated at a height of 4 cm for comparison of root biomass to sedimentation characteristics. Fine root fraction estimates were taken via soil cores and washing of mineral soil and particulate OC to achieve just the fine root fraction, which was compared with surface elevation data. Key results: The results provided several key findings: The results showed that Rhizophora roots had significantly higher rates of sediment accretion relative to the others. The authors attribute it to increased turbulence and thus flocculation of suspended sediment, reduction in flow which traps it within the root complex, and thus higher rates of sediment accretion during slack flows No significant differences among functional root types for elevation change were found across all basins, but root type x river basin interactions were found to be significant (control plots or pneumatophores having higher rates of positive sediment surface elevation change). Elevation chane rates were found to occur through series of “pulses” rather than steady through time Lower rate of surface elevation change in Rhizophora was suggested to potentially having to do with the lower ratio of lignin:Nitrogen in the fine root fraction, which may have been more decomposible and thus result in elevation decreases. Root area and root density did not have significant influence on monthly rates of vertical accretion. Furthermore, found that surface elevation change in Avicennia pneumatophores was highest, and the authors conclude that organic matter contribution is thus significant – might have implications for research questions. 4.3.6 Adame et al, 2010 “Sedimentation within and among mangrove forests along a gradient of geomorphological settings” (Adame et al. 2010) Key contribution: This is one of the few studies that empirically tests for differences in sedimentation rates amongst different geomorphological settings and different forest types (fringe vs. scrub vs. algal mats) within the different geomorphological settings. Study design: The study primarily employs petri dishes held to the forest floor as well as water samples to example differences in total suspended sediment, sediment accretion and the presence of glomalin (a secretion produced by terrestrial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) across forest types/settings. Glomalin was used as an indicator of terrestrially versus other derived sediments, as AMF largely do not exist in mangroves and thus this would be indicative of terrestrially derived sediments. Replicates plots in the fringe, scrub, and upper-tidal (algal mats) portions of six different sites, which were a variation of river-dominated vs. tide-dominated geomorphological settings, were established. Samples from the water column and sediment deposition on petri dishes were taken to investigate variation in deposition patterns. Interestingly, the study also used PCA of several environmental variables to establish a quantitative measure of the geomorphic setting. Among the environmental variables included were: Salinity Catchment area (km2) - unsure specifically what this is DIstance to sea (km) - unsure as to how this measure was taken Entrance section area (m2) - unsure as to what this is Key results: Their results found that sedimentation patterns varied between geomorphic types, as well as environmental settings within the river-dominated vs. tide-dominated settings. Export of total suspended sediment: No relationship between sediment retention and geomorphological setting was found. For those sites that did show retention of total suspended sediment (TSS), retention was found during the ebb tide in the fringe and scrub zones. Sedimentation: The fringe zone was found to have the highest sedimentation rates, which the authors attribute to the greater density of vegetation (and thus AG root complexes? though they do not specify tree species). A relationship between sedimentation rate and geomorphological setting was not found. In general, sedimentation was evenly distributed in riverine dominated geomorphological settings, whereas tidal mangroves found majority of sedimentation to occur in the fringe zone. Glomalin: The amount of glomalin was correlated to its age (determined via immunoreactivity), and riverine sites were found to have much higher and younger amounts of glomalin than tidal sites in the TSS. In the deposited sediments, glomalin did not correlate with geomorphological setting, but did exhibit differences between intertidal zones within riverine and tidal settings. The majority of glomalin deposited in riverine settings occurred in the scrub zone, whereas the majority in tidal settings occured in the fringe zone. References "],

The authors find high variability across the sites, and conclude that while at some sites mangrove contributions to SOC are very high, others may be dominated primarily by organic matter of marine origin. This is one of the first studies to examine sources of organic matter in mangrove sediments. Key notes: Concentrations of organic carbon, total nitrogen, elemental ratios (C/N) and carbon stable isotopes were taken from soil samples to 5 cm depth, as well as from leaf litter in each of the sites. The geomorphology and species compositions of each of the sites were different. C/N ratios of suspended particulate organic matter are typically much lower that those of mangrove litter and thus may act as an important source of N in sediment food webs. Study design They sampled soil and leaf litter as well as compose mixing models to investigate the relative contributions of mangrove derived organic matter versus marine derived organic matter. Mixing models are a way of modeling relative contributions (often two end-members) to a system. In this case, it is the contribution of mangrove derived versus marine derived organic matter to total sediment organic matter. Key results Sediments underneath Rhizophora were found to have higher OC concentrations than Avicennia and Excoecaria species at two of the sites. Lower OC concentrations coincided with lower C/N ratios and less negative C-13 isotope values, whereas soils with rich OC concentrations had higher C/N ratios and C-13 values closer to those of the mangrove leaf litter. Appears there is an inverse relationship between OC content and C-13 values. Although they note that organic C in mangrove sediment may originate entirely from mangrove-derived organic matter, they note that this is likely to be not the norm. From the Coringa site, they find that suspended OM in the water column is significant and likely derived from phytoplankton-derived matter. They describe the differences as “flow-through” systems versus “accumulation” systems, which may largely be a result of tidal amplitude (flushing) of system. Mangrove litter has relatively high C/N ratio, and thus the influx of marine organic matter may be significant for provisioning of N rich material to microbial communities. Notes on stable isotopes Stable isotopes can be used for sourcing of organic matter and are commonly used in marine ecosystems. Stable isotope compositions are typically expressed in “parts per thousand differences from a standard.” I.e.: \\[\\delta X = [(R_{sample}/R_{standard})-1]*10^{3} \\] Where: X represents the isotope of interest (i.e., 13C) R represents ratio of isotope of interest and its standard form (13C to 12C). Higher values (less negative) represent increases in concentrations of the isotope of interest relative to the standard, whereas lower values represent decreases in isotope of interest relative to standard. Carbon isotopes allow for understanding of primary production sources in an ecosystem. Transfer of 13C through trophic levels is relatively the same, except for slight increase (&lt;1 ppt) in concentration. 4.4.4 Krauss, 2003 “Differential rates of vertical accretion and elevation change among aerial root types in Micronesian mangrove forests” 4.4.5 Lovelock, 2008 “Soil respiration and belowground carbon allocation in mangrove forests” 4.4.6 Breithaupt, 2012 “Organic carbon burial rates in mangrove sediments: Strengthening the global budget” 4.4.7 Lunstrum, 2014 “Soil carbon stocks and accumulation in young mangrove forests” 4.4.8 Atwood, 2017 “Global patterns in mangrove soil carbon stocks and losses” (Atwood et al. 2017) Key contribution: The study provides an updated estimate of SOC patterns globally, through the lens of national scales. Key notes: They describe the data quality (relatively poor) for SOC, although their database is likely less extensive than that of the ERL paper. They note the widespread prevalence of pedotransfer functions to estimate bulk density, as well as a common lack of SOC estimates deeper than 50 cm. National and global trends: Found a pattern in mean SOC per ha across latitudinal bands, but did not find total SOC to correlate with latitudinal change. Found mixed species stands to have higher SOC than monospecific stands; stands with 5 genera had 70-90% higher soil C stocks than other richness levels. There are implications here, particularly for restoration efforts which typically focus on Rhizophora or Avicennia species. Almost all variation at national level was explained by extent of mangroves, which points to the need for improved methods for estimating and mapping mangrove area. Data did not exist for 44 countries in which mangroves occur. They did not examine variation in mean SOC density across nations or global scales. Indonesia, Malaysia, USA, and Brazil have the highest potential C emissions from deforestation, accounting for a total of approximately 86% of stocks. Other countries with very high density (higher than these four) currently have low rates of deforestation, and thus may constrain total C emissions from mangroves. Prioritizing conservation of mangroves in these countries may be critical. Myanmar may be a highly significant country in terms of C emissions and deforestation. References "],

Key findings: the spectral and spatial composition of mangrove species and vegetation assemblages has complicated use of multispectral (broadband) imagery; hyperspectral (narrowband) imagery is promising but more difficult to access spectral signatures of different wetland veg are often similar, and are “muddied” by spectral reflectance from soil, hydrologic regime or atmospheric conditions spectral signatures affected most strongly by biochemical and biophysical properties of leaves, which vary greatly across species discrimination of wetland species from Landsat TM or SPOT imagery has generally been insufficient due to: lack of fine, ecological divisions between vegetation species broad nature of spectral wavebands lack of high spectral and spatial resolution to detect subcanopy vegetation types ANNs and fuzzy classification techniques have shown promise in better classifying mixed species pixels most important biochemical and biophysical properties characterizing wetland species are: chlorophyll - green pigment biomass concentration - biophysical prop leaf water content major issue of using vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) to estimate biomass is the saturation problem Mutanga and Skidmore (2004) propose one mechanism to resolve saturation problem building spectral libraries via hyperspectral sensors is critical for discriminating wetland species, but also needs investigation at different sites &amp; scales as reflectance within species may vary depending on environmental conditions Research ideas: Spectral imagery can be effective in monitoring plant water content, which may vary significantly across mangrove species due to differing water use efficiencies Further reading: 5.1.3 Heumann, 2011 “Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities” (Heumann 2011) Key contribution: One of several reviews of mangroves and remote sensing techniques that focuses primarily (i.e., solely) on vegetation mapping.

Notes: Optical imagery: The spectral signature of mangrove leaves are largely a function of age, vitality, phenological props and physiological props. Greater discrimination between species (at least in Vietnam) may be seen in the NIR, but little differentiation seen in VIS: Radar imagery: SAR imagery provides intensity values of the “backscatter coefficient”. Given different polarizations and wavelengths of SAR scanning, different interactions with mangrove landscape occur. The different SAR bands are as follows: X-band - 3 cm wavelength, effective for direct backscatter from canopy C-band - 6 cm, plant/soil multiple and volume scattering L-band - 24 cm, direct backscatter from soil &amp; water Sensors: See Table 2 in the study for an extensive list of sensors used within remote sensing of mangrove studies Aerial imagery is limited in that it cannot be scaled beyond immediate site/locality, but has value in that it can provide high-resolution data particularly for hard to access sites without field data. High spatial resolution data (IKONOS &amp; Quickbird) Ultimate goal is to map mangroves at the species level A comparison of IKONOS and QuickBird found IKONOS (4 m) to be more effective at discriminating in species because of the higher spectral resolution. QuickBird has higher spatial resolution (1 m) but was less useful in this particular investigation (Greg’s paper). Hyperspectral imagery identifying relevant bands is a time intensive process and many bands are highly correlated EnMAP sensor satellite hyperspectral data that will provide more access to hyperspectral datasets globally is this online? I’m not sure yet. Several tables are given in the paper that describe the various data sensors and platforms and their relative benefits and limitations for remote sensing of mangroves. Needs within RS of mangroves space: The authors call for several needs within the remote sensing of mangrove space: Need for homogenized classification schemes - ontologies, e.g., what is a sparse versus dense mangrove Need for standardized data-processing models - standardiziing preprocessing, processing and post processing such that enhanced comparability of studies is enabled Need for homogenized transparent accuracy assessment - self explanatory Need for further investigations of synergistic data use - coupling of new, novel and disparate RS datasets to investigate novel research questions Need for ecosystem service assessments Need for interdisciplinary and well-networked research teams 5.1.5 Giri, 2016 “Observation and monitoring of mangrove forests using remote sensing: Opportunities and challenges” (Giri 2016) Key contribution: This is an introductory piece to a special issue on monitoring mangroves using RS.

In particular, the study seeks out to answer two primary questions: What are the spectral and structural changes within and between mangrove species and community types? What are the relationships between the canopy spectral variability at the blue, green, red and NIR wavelength regions and canopy species composition and structural variability? Their results largely showed that remote sensing of species composition is quite difficult (no relationships between species composition and spectral indices exist), but LAI and a few other parameters (canopy height) were found to be significantly correlated with some spectral bands/vegetation indices. Research design: Field structure and species composition data was collected and coupled with remotely sensed spectral data. Regression and other statistical techniques were used to relate the data to the various spectral measures and their arithmetic transforms. Spectral measurements were taken in the lab, from a helicopter platform, and also from SPOT satellite. Key notes &amp; results: The following results and key conclusion of the study should be noted: LAI was calculated as a transform of canopy closure, which was collected with a hemispherical mirror Significant correlations of any of the bands with percent species composition was not significant The strongest correlations between spectral signatures and forest structure data was with LAI LAI was not significantly correlated with species composition, but was significantly correlated with forest height, which indicates that canopy depth expands with increasing canopy height. 5.2.2 Green, 1998 “Remote sensing techniques for mangrove mapping” (Green et al. 1998) Key significance: The study reviews common methods of remote sensing for mangrove mapping, with a particular emphasis on the fact that accuracy assessments are rarely performed following classification of RS mangrove imagery. The authors then couple the most commonly used techniques with accuracy assessments using field-based data to examine the relative strengths &amp; weaknesses of the different techniques. Research design: The study employs three spectral image datasets (Landsat 6 TM, SPOT, and Airborne multispectral data at 1 m resolution) for generating of RS imagery of mangroves in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The review of classificatin of spectral imagery for mangroves identifies 5 different methodologies: Visual interpretation - the user classifies areas, though often with a radiometric enhancement applied to the imagery Vegetation index - different vegetation indices can be employed such as ratio indices (NDVI) or orthogonal indices (tasseled cap transformations); this study uses NDVI with a ISODATA clustering algorithm producing 50 classes that are identified and edited to match mangroves Unsupervised classification - may or may not involve image enhancement; this study used ISODATA clustering algo on unenhanced imagery Supervised classification - most common method of mangrove classification and may or may not include image enhancement (e.g., enhancing edges between stands or species types); this study uses 3 x 3 edge enhancement filter applied to imagery, useful in mangroves given linear nature PCA and band ratios - ratios of different bands can be effective in distinguishing different landscape features; this study uses the ratios of various Landsat and SPOT bands, runs PCA, and then generates an image based on the most significant PCAs (which they then classify) Accuracy assessment was performed using three metrics (following Congalton, 1991): Overall accuracy - overall agreement as sum of correctly labelled sites divided by total number of sites User accuracy - probability that a classified pixel actually represents that category on the ground Producer accuracy - how often real features on ground are shown correctly on the map; NOT used in this study] Tau coefficient - indicates the percent of pixels classified correctly than would be expected by chance alone Key results: The authors largely justify the work based on: A lack of widespread accuracy assessments within the literature A discussion of the limitations of climate on spectral RS imagery classification (although their methods only examine spectral datasets; they give SAR a head nod in the review section) Discrimination of mangrove vs. non-mangrove vegetation: SPOT XS imagery was not effective at producing accurate classifications of mangrove extent. CASI (airborne) data was highly effective at identifying mangrove vegetation (with all five methods producing overall accuracies greater than 50%), whereas methods performed on Landsat data improved markedly with increased computational sophistication (i.e., method 5). Accurate classification of Landsat data required the calculation of PCs and band ratios, rather than processing of just raw band data. In general, visual identification and ratio index based classifications are not effective at classifying mangroves. Additionally, merging of Landsat TM and SPOT XP (i.e., down-sampling Landsat data) was found to be effective at improving mapping classifications (using both a principle components merge, as well as an intensity-hue-saturation merge). Discrimination of mangrove habitats: The results show that the airborne spectral data (CASI) was most effective at accurately classifying 9 different mangrove classes. Reasonable classification accuracies could be achieved with the Landsat data for a reworking of just three mangrove classes (tall Rhizophora, other mangrove, and non-mangrove), but were highly inaccurate for a 9-class map. Note: There is a nice table of other works on mangrove mapping and remote sensing in the introduction. It may be good to review this table again at a later date. 5.2.3 Proisy, 2000 “Interpretation of polarimetric radar signatures of mangrove forests” (Proisy et al. 2000) Key contribution: This study reviews the interaction of backscattering signals of different polarizations of SAR data with components of a mangrove forest. Research design: The study took field-based data on forest structure and species composition, as well as collected data from the P-, L-, and C-Bands of AIRSAR data (NASA JPL; airborne SAR). They calculated a number of backscattering coefficients for each of the polarizations (HH, VV and HV), as well as the copolarization ratio (VV/HH) as well as two cross-polarization ratios (HH/HV and VV/HV). The different bands were acquired at a mean incidence angle of 35 degrees at: P-band: 0.44 GHz L-band: 1.25 GHz C-band: 5.3 GHz Key findings: Within the L-band, surface scattering or double-bounce effects dominate up until approximately 150-200 Mg/ha, whereas volume scattering (i.e., within the canopy) dominates for biomass values greater than 150-200 Mg/ha. The dominant contributer to the backscattering coefficient depends on the type of forest being monitored. For example: Mature or declining stands with biomass greater than 300 Mg/ha have volume scatter at all frequencies. Mature or declining stands with biomass between 100 - 300 Mg/ha have dominant volume scattering at C-band, volume and double-bounce scattering at L-band, and double-bounce scattering at P-band Pioneer stages with less than 100 Mg/ha biomass have volume scattering present in all three polarizations of C-band, double-bounce or surface scattering at L-band, and all three present (though interaction term is strongest) at the L-band for all three polarizations. Overall, P-band provides most pronounced polarimetric signatures, and is the most useful for distinguishing between different scattering mechanisms and thus different forest stages. A nice summary figure of the interactions between forest structure and radar returns is below: Notes: Prior studies have found that there is a strong positive relation between SAR backscattering coefficients and total biomass, particularly for P-HV and L-HV. The main contributions to the total backscattering coefficient response are: the soil scattering component the volume scattering component the double-bounce scattering component 5.2.4 Proisy, 2002 “On the influence of canopy structure on radar backscattering in mangrove forests” (Proisy et al. 2002) Key significance: One of a series of studies by Proisy et al, this particular study examines two mangrove forest stands of near identical aboveground biomass, but markedly different forest structure. They examine the polarimetric SAR data that they collect from the two plots, and examine them in relation to the two different forest structures. The forest structures both contain ~75 Mg biomass/ha, but are structured as: A pioneer stand of L. racemosa that is extremely dense (~12,000 trees/ha) and has much higher basal area (21.0 m2/ha) A declining stand with two canopy strata: A. germinans that are dying off and form an open, tall canopy (250 trees/ha, 4.2 m2/ha &amp; 19 m height) R. mangle that are replacing the A. germinans (31 trees/ha, 0.2 m2/ha &amp; 8 m height) Research design: The same research methods as (Proisy et al. 2000) (see Section 5.2.3) were employed, but this particular study focused on an in-depth comparison of two plots with similar aboveground biomass values, but markedly different forest structure characteristics. Key results: Overall, the backscattering from the open stand was higher than that of the closed (pioneer) stand. With the help of a polarimetric scattering model, they found that the three primary contributers to backscattering (volume vs. interaction vs. surface scattering) differed between the two stands for select polarizations. Additionally, they note two key concluding remarks: Use of correlation backscatter to biomass relationships should be restricted to homogeneous closed canopies. Distinguishing between stands of different developmental status should be possible via differences in backscaterring coefficients of the different SAR bands and polarizations A key figure that shows some of these differences is shown below: 5.2.5 Mutanga, 2004 “Narrow band vegetation indices solve the saturation problem in biomass estimation” (Mutanga and Skidmore 2004) Key significance: This study addresses the issue of vegetation index saturation at high biomass levels, and examines the effectiveness of hyperspectral data for resolving the issue. The study is largely motivated given that the “major limitation of using vegetation indices is asymptotic approach of a saturation level after a certain biomass density or LAI” Red edge - The rise of reflectance at the boundary between chlorophyll absorption in red wavelengths and leaf scattering in NIR wavelengths (680-750 nm). Red edge position can be defined as the point of maximum slope on the red infrared curve, and can be calculated by identifying the maximum of the first derivative Research design: The study primarily focuses on two approaches to resolving the saturation issue with biomass and vegetation indices: Use of narrow band vegetation indices, which are simply NDVI, Simple Ratio (SR) and Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI), but for 637 bands of hyperspectral data (350-2500 nm) Use of the red edge position A grass was grown in a greenhouse with two different nitrogen treatments (and one control group), and hyperspectral signatures were repeatedly taken. The various indices are computed for narrow band vegetation indices as well as indices using the red edge position. Key results: NDVI - The results clearly indicate an improvement in a relationship between biomass and an NDVI index derived from red edge spectral bands rather than standard (NIR and red) bands. SR - The results from the SR tests are similar to that of NDVI; reconstruction of SR using all possible hyperspectral band combinations indicates that bands from the red edge portion are most sensitive to changes in biomass TVI - Although distribution of the R2 values for reconstruction of this index differed visually from that of NDVI and SR (which were quite similar), the most efficient TVI was found to be constructed from bands in the red edge portion of the spectrum. The green portion of the spectrum also did well (e.g., second “best”) in reconstructing the vegetation indices. Red edge position - The red edge position was found to have a high correlation coefficient with biomass, indicating there is a significant correlation Of the three vegetation indices, SR was found to have the strongest correlation with biomass. Thus, narrow band derivations of SR from the red edge portion of the wavelength spectrum may be most efficient in estimating biomass from spectral data. 5.2.6 Wang, 2004a “Comparison of IKONOS and QuickBird images for mapping mangrove species on the Caribbean coast of Panama” (Wang et al. 2004) Key contribution: This study employs high resolution IKONOS (Space Imaging) and QuickBird (DigitalGlobe) imagery for improved mapping of mangrove species at Punta Galeta, Panama. In particular the study seeks to compare the imagery sources across three primary criteria: Spectral quality using subjective visual inspection and overall spectral statistics Classification effectiveness using multispectral bands with and without panchromatic bands Classification effectiveness following inclusion of textural information Research design: IKONOS (4 m multi, 1 m pan) and QuickBird (2.8 m multispec, 0.7 m panchrom) imagery were bought for the region and geometrically corrected. Training and validation plots for the major land cover classes (red, white, and black mangroves, roads, lagoons, and rainforest) were established and data were collected. MLC was used for classification of imagery using four multispectral bands, as well as a resampled panchromatic band at the resolution of the multispectral band resolution. Additionally, spectral information using the high resolution data of the imagery were computed and included within the classification algorithms. Two “order” textural layers were derived: A first order layer that was a simple measure of local variance within different sized rectangular neighborhoods that were coupled with the multispectral bands. A second order layer that uses a gray-level co-occurrence matrix to derive three features: contrast, correlation and entropy (see Clausi, 2002) Finally, an object-based approach was employed using the second order texture data. The image was segmented into objects, and then classification was applied to the resultant objects. Key results: The results generally show that the high resolution multispectral datasets were effective in accurate classifications of mangrove species. In particular: Standard deviation and entropy of the multispectral data for IKONOS was consistently higher than that of QuickBird, indicating that IKONOS captures richer spectral information than QuickBird Classification using purely multispectral data was slightly better for IKONOS than QuickBird Addition of the panchromatic band did not significantly improve accuracies Inclusion of a first order texture band improved accuracies for the IKONOS image; HOWEVER, accuracies decreased for QuickBird imagery, with the exception of the largest window size Second order texture data did not produce accurate classifications by themselves Under the object-based approach (using textural information in panchromatic and multispectral bands), almost equivalent classification accuracies were achieved It is important to note that the results do not support the expectation that the slightly higher spatial resolution of QuickBird imagery would result in “better” textural information for classification accuracies. Further reading: Textural analyses: Clausi, 2002 - An analysis of co-occurrence texture statistics as a function of grey level quantization Haralick et al, 1973 - Textural features for image classification 5.2.7 Wang, 2004b “Integration of object-based and pixel-based classification for mapping mangroves with IKONOS imagery” (Wang, Sousa, and Gong 2004) Key significance: This is a sister study to the study reviewed in Section @(wang2004a). This study sought to examine three different classification methods: MLC at the pixel level Nearest neighbor classification at the pixel level A hybrid classification that combines pixel and object based methods (MLCNN) The consider the conundrum that with increasing spatial resolution, the number of detectable sub-class elements increases as well and thus classification at the pixel level may deteriorate. Thus, they examine object-based classification as a means of getting around this particular issue. Research design: For the site and imagery description see Section @(wang2004a). The different classification approaches used in this study are described here: MLC at pixel level - Object-based classification - Used eCognition 3.0 software (region merging technique that uses a homogeneity criteria to detemine whether pixels and regions should be merged). The merging “breaks off” at a predetermined parameter (small param = small regions, large param = large regions), and there are in principle infinite choices of break-off parameters* The authors develop a joint procedure in which MLC at pixel level is first used, in which spectrally inseparable classes are identified, and all spectrally separable classes are masked out. An object-based classification procedure is then performed on the spectrally inseparable classes. * To deal with the issue of infinate scale parameters, Wang et al develop a method to identify an optimal value. They use the training set data from the MLC image, reclassify all other pixels as 0s, and then use the image segmentation approach for several scale parameters. They then derive the pairwise Bhattacharya Distance values for the seven land cover classes at each scale, and select the scale at which BD reaches a maximum. Key results: In general, the accuracy of the classifications were relatively high for all three methods; however, the mixed pixel and object-based method performed the best. The key results are: The pixel based approach generally did well in correctly classifying the land cover classes (88.9% overall accuracy), with the exception of the red mangroves (71.3% accuracy), black mangroves (81.8%) and rainforest (81%) The object-based approach improved classification of the rainforest (100%0), red mangroves (77.5%) and black mangroves (89.8%), but greatly misclassified white mangroves (21.9%) due to their existence along edges with red and black and thus being pulled into “objects”; overall accuracy was relatively lower relative to the pixel based approach as a result (80.4%) The mixed pixel and object-based method performed the best because white mangrove, road, gap and lagoon all were highly separable using MLC, but distinguishing between red mangrove, black mangrove and rainforest benefitted from the object-based method (due to high confusion between these classes) The mixed method approach achieved overall classification accuracies of 91.4%. Key conclusions: The following conclusions are of particular note: The pixel-based method retains the spectral information at a fine spatial scale, but does not excel at distinguishing between spectrally similar classes (rainforest, red &amp; black mangrove) The object-based method averages spectral information, but in doing so is able to improve discrimination between spectrally similar regions (the difficult classes mentioned above) However, you run the risk of averaging unrelated pixels (likely unavoidable) 5.2.8 Vaiphasa, 2005 “Tropical mangrove species discrimination using hyperspectral data: A laboratory study” (Vaiphasa et al. 2005) Key contribution: At the time this study was written, hyperspectral studies of mangrove species classifications were relatively limited, and fairly inconclusive. This study soeeks to examine whether mangrove canopy leaves have sufficient spectral information to discriminate mangroves at the species level. Sixteen mangrove species were examined. Research design: Canopy leaves from 16 species were collected in Chumphon and hyperspectral signatures at 2151 spectral bands from 400 - 2500 nm were collected in laboratory conditions. One way ANOVA was used to examine for differences of individual species from one another across all spectral bands, and spectral separability of the species using a Jeffries-Matusita distance analysis metric. Given the issue of a massive feature space (2151 bands), four “optimal” bands for assessing spectral separability were identified using a wrapper feature selection approach. Key results: The results generally show that discrimination between the sixteen species is generally achievable. Some particular key results include: 1941 of the 2151 bands were found to be spectrally dissimilar across all species (ANOVA analysis) at th p &lt; 0.05 level. Of these 1941, 477 bands were significant at the &lt; 0.01 level. The exceptions were primarily at the UV region (350-400 nm) and the shortwave infrared region (1800-2500 nm), where lighting conditions may have played an influential role. The optimal band combination for classification was found to be: 720 nm, 1277 nm, 1415 nm and 1644 nm These results indicate that other properties beyond pigment (which would correspond to the 720 nm band) may play important roles in discrimination, and may be a result of other ecophysiological factors (water content, salinity, sugar, protein, oil, lignin, cellulose, leaf structure, etc.) Pair-wise separability of mangrove species was possible for many of the species using these four bands and the J-M distance metric, but reduced separability was seen for species of the Rhizophoraceae family. There was high confusion both amongst species within Rhizophoraceae, as well as with S. ovata, X. granatum and Pluchea indica. Further reading: Wayne and Le’s study of lab hyperspectral indices: Wang et al, 2009 - Distinguishing mangrove species with laboratory measurements of hyperspectral leaf reflectance 5.2.9 Vaiphasa, 2006 “A post-classifier for mangrove mapping using ecological data” (Vaiphasa, Skidmore, and Boer 2006) Key contribution: This is one of the first studies to employ environmental data (pH) to refine classification maps of mangrove species. The study finds that classification accuracies are increased significantly, from 76.04% to 88.21%. Research design: The study coupled an existing mangrove species map produced from classification of ASTER imagery with a map of pH throught Pak Panang mangroves to examine the effectiveness of a post-classifier. In particular, they collected 200 pH measurements distributed throughout the forest, 150 of which were used for interpolation of a salinity profile, and 50 of which were used for validation. They additionall collected species composition and forest structure data at &gt;500 plots of 15 x 15 m2 in the forest, and used these for accuracy assessment of the maps. The post-classifier was based on a Bayesian approach that employed probabilities of species given a pH level, and pH level given a species. Key results: Accuracy of the mangrove species map was improved significantly with the addition of the pH data. In particular: Overall accuracy was improved from 76.04 - 88.21% following inclusion of pH data Speckling within the original mangrove species map was greatly reduced following inclusion of the pH layer Confusion between R. mucronata and S. caseolaris persisted despite the inclusion of the pH data In reference to the results from Vaiphasa (2005), they found that the addition of the pH data was able to improve the separability of species within the Rhizophoraceae family (which exhibited high confusion following classification of hyperspectral data) The authors conclude that the method presented (classification followed by updating with ecological gradient data) may be an efficient means for producing detailed mangrove species maps in areas that are not too large (e.g., &lt; 100 km2). 5.2.10 Wang, 2009 “Distinguishing mangrove species with laboratory measurements of hyperspectral leaf reflectance” (Wang and Sousa 2009) Key contribution: Le and Wayne largely repeat the Vaiphasa, 2005 study (see Section 5.2.8) but for the three mangrove species common to central America. In addition, they examine the ability of hyperspectral data to estimate stress conditions in mangrove trees. Research design: They collected leaves from all three species in both stressed and unstressed conditions, and also collected leaves from the top and bottom portions of the canopy. They then subjected each of the leaves to hyperspectral measurements in a laboratory setting before analyzing the data. To reduce the feature space prior to spectral discrimination, they first used the ANOVA across all spectral bands to remove any bands that were non significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level (a la Vaiphasa, 2005). They then use Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) to examine for differences amongst the species. In addition, they use several indices of spectral bands identified by prior work as indices of leaf stress. Chlorophyl a and b contents drop dramatically in stressed leaves, greatly changing the reflectance properties of leaves. Studies have found that ratios are best in identifying stress characteristics, and they use these within ANOVA to compare means of ratios between stressed and unstressed leaves. Key results: The results generally find that hyperspectral data is effective in species discrimination and also identification of stressed mangrove trees. Some particularly key results are as follows: 116 of the 215 bands were significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level for distinguishing between species and were clustered in the 350-510 nm, 610-690 nm, 760-810 nm, 1370-1550 nm, and 1850-2500 nm ranges of the spectrum Red, white and black mangroves were capable of being discriminated using the hyperspectral data Use of the ratios for identifying stress in mangrove trees was effective, with different ratios performing better for different species (3/4 for red, 1/4 for white, and 4/4 for black) The specific band widths identified as significant in this study different from those of Vaiphasa, 2005 Key conclusions: Some key, broader-level conclusion from the study are as follows: Conventional challenges to analysing hyperspectral data are the large number of highly correlated bands available coupled with relatively smaller numbers of training and test samples. Wang and Sousa conclude that use of hyperspectral data is effective in overcoming the shortcomings of the multispectral datasets that they use in their 2004 sister studies. 5.2.11 Kamal, 2011 “Hyperspectral data for mangrove species mapping: A comparison of pixel-based and object-based approach” (Kamal and Phinn 2011) Key contribution: This study employs high resolution, hyperspectral data to map mangroves and wetland land classes at a landscape scale in Australia using three different methods. There are relevant points they make but the study feels somewhat lacking in general. Research design: CASI-2 hyperspectral data were used as the imagery (30 bands and 4 m spatial resolution) in this study. An existing digital map of mangrove species produced via photographic interpretation of aerial imagery, site data, and traverses was used for endmembers selection and accuracy assessments of the classifications. They use three different classification procedures to produce different maps of the landscape: Spectral angle mapper – uses a spectral library representative of different end members (i.e., the 9 targeted wetland classes) and assigns pixel to each based on a similarity measure Linear spectral unmixing – assumes each spectral signature is a linear combination of area weighted sum of reflectance of endmembers; total areas or pixels may then be assigned based on probabilistic basis Object-based mapping – used OBIA to segment the image before applying classification algorithms on the spectral signatures Key results: Of the three methods examined, OBIA performed the best (overall classification accuracy of 76%). Linear spectral unmixing produced the lowest overall classification accuracy. Conclusion: The classification accuracy is relatively lower than those found in other studies, and thus the results feel perhaps a bit short-sighted. Other metrics that could have been interesting to explore would have been texture given the high resolution nature of the dataset. Additionally, they do not dig into the hyperspectral bandwidths that are relevant, and thus there is valuable information that is missing from the study. Additionally, it is not entirely clear to me whether they used the coarse level reference map for their accuracy assessment, or whether field data was collected. If the reference map is of low-quality, their results are rather meaningless. 5.2.12 Dronova, 2012 “Landscape analysis of wetland plant functional types: The effects of image segmentation scale, vegetation classes and classification methods” (Dronova et al. 2012) Key contribution: This study examines the classification accuracy of plant functional types (PFTs) under different image segmentation scales and classification algorithms for Poyang Lake in China. The key results generally show that use of a coarser image scale (on average 5-8 Landsat pixels) significantly improved image classification of the different PFTs. Classification between the different algorithms were less significant. Research design: Field data for training and test validation were collected, and Landsat 5 TM data (bands 1-5 &amp; 7) were used for all image classification procedures. Image segmentation was performed at 9 different scales from (2 - 10), and six different classification algorithms were used: Bayesian Logistic Neural network Decision trees K-Nearest neighbors Support vector machines The image classification procedure was performed under two scenarios, the first being for generalized PFTs (3 classes), and the second being for specific PFTs (6 classes). Water, sand and other development were excluded prior to classification. Cluster analysis was performed on morphological and physiological data of the 51 species within the landscape to identify the different classes. Additionally, texture metrics within objects were computed and included in the classification procedure to examine their utility. Key results: The results found that OBIA generally improved the results of the classification for both the 3-class and 6-class sets Some specific results include: A scale of 8 was found to produce the highest classification accuracies for both classification sets (i.e., objects of 5-8 Landsat pixels) However, at the specific PFT level, the optimal scale parameter was found to be variable Texture metrics were not found to significantly improve classification accuracies, indicating that discrimination between the various classes was primarily spectrally based Overall classification accuracy was relatively similar for the different classification algorithms The authors conclude that smoothing of spectral signatures within objects lends to greater discrimination between PFTs, aiding in overall classification. Texture metrics may have proven to be insignificant in improving classification accuracies due to the relatively coarse nature of the Landsat data. Most other studies that have found texture to be significant have used high resolution imagery. Human interference and ecological conditions that produced mixed pixels resulted in reduced classification accuracy, and the authors conclude that mixed approaches (i.e., object-based followed by pixel-based, a la (Wang, Sousa, and Gong 2004)) may be an interesting means of resolving this issue. However, propagation of uncertainty has been under-explored and will be important in such scenarios. 5.2.13 Giri et al, 2014 “A study on abundance and distribution of mangrove species in Indian Sundarban using remote sensing technique” (Giri et al. 2014) References "],

The article primarily discusses: Defining biocomplexity Examining the characteristics of biocomplexity Speculating on the future of biocomplexity Biocomplexity - “properties emerging from the interplay of behavioral, biological, chemical, physical, and social interactions that affect, sustain, or are modified by living organisms, including humans,” as defined by (Michener et al. 2001) Key notes: Biocomplexity exists in contrast to the Popperian type of reductionalist science (causality &amp; falsification), and recognizes that reduced causal mechanisms often are not robust within real-world situations “myriad confounding factors operating at different temporal and spatial scales” Two features of “biocomplexity” biocomplexity occurs as temporal, spatial and conceptual boundaries are broken-down and worked across emergent &amp; unexpected properties may (or likely will) arise in response to biocomplexity Characteristics of “biocomplexity”: Relevant for a wide range of organisms; from microbial to megafauna (including humans) Relevant for a wide range of environments Reflected in nonlinear, chaotic, or unpredictable behaviors – which likely necessitates sophisticated and innovative quantitative procedures Likely to span many hierarchical levels as well as across multiples scales in time and space Key research trajectories for ecology (as posed by Thompson 2001): “Dynamics of coalescence in complex communities” - how do environmental constraints and species availability result in current complex ecological communities “Ecological memory” - how do past events &amp; conditions influence current ecological structure and conditions “Emergent properties” - examining whether the first principles of “hard” sciences can predict composition, structure &amp; function “Ecological topology” - identifying “rules” that occur over different scales of time and space, and examining how they interact to produce ecosystems Further reading: (Thompson et al. 2001) - Frontiers of ecology: As ecological research enters a new era of collaboration, integration, and technological sophistication, four frontiers (listed above) seem paramount for understanding how biological and physical processes interact over multiple spatial and temporal scales to shape the Earth’s biodiversity 6.1.2 Jones et al, 2006 “The new bioinformatics: Integrating ecological data from the gene to the biosphere” (Jones et al. 2006) Key contribution: This paper makes the case for “locating, accessing and integrating” data within ecology. They provide examples of the successes associated with doing so in alternative fields (genetics), and make a case for the need within ecology. They also outline vertically integrated databases (data warehouses) versus metadata-driven databases (data collections), and the relative pros/cons of the two. Examples of metadata and data collections in ecology: Key notes: Some relevant points from the article: A focus on “experimental” design and testing of multiple hypotheses makes ecological data inherently heterogeneous. Ecoinformatics importance is housed in ability to “allow a broader perspective over time and space, and across many disciplines, than is possible from on or a few studies,” and in allowing data to be reused for questions that may emerge in the future (thus may fit well with “biocomplex” framework). Current standard for storing of data is in heterogeneous spreadsheets, which are termed “data islands”. The response of ecoinformatics to resolving issues related to data islands are largely: Data warehouses (vertically-integrated) - databases that coalesce data from many investigators, but focus on one theme and are searchable often through an online interface Often represents a “least-common denominator” approach in that they are less complex than original dataset Examples: GenBank, VegBank or TreeBase Data collections (metadata-driven) - collection of datasets that are loosely structured together by well-crafted metadata. Some advantages are: Data of disparate types can be housed within a single location Focuses on project-level data and thus is familiar to researchers Metadata often more detailed Metadata often more precise and thus can be used in search functions Metadata standards - “consistent and rigorous sets of definitions for metadata categories that are broadly adopted by a research community.” Several examples exist within ecology: Ecological Metadata Language (EML) Biological Data Profile (BDP) Geographic Markup Language (GML) Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) - a metadata-drive repo that provides mappings from EML to BDP (but not from BDP to EML as of time of article publication) Databasing and development of meta data is often subject to entrenched domain-specific vocabularies and also assumptions; ontologies may be a way of resolving this limitation “Ontologies”*&quot; - well-defined concepts or terms that have precise meanings within a specific domain or field, as well as formal mappings of how the terms interrelate “Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge (SEEK)” - one example of a system developing ontologies within ecology “Darwin Core”- another provider of ontologies, particularly for evolution related concepts; extension of Dublin Core for biodiversity informatics (GBIF uses it) Further reading: Look into metadata languages (e.g., EML) Look into some of the earlier work on databases by Michener 6.1.3 Michener, 2006 “Meta-information concepts for ecological data management” (Michener 2006) Definitions: Metadata - information about data, i.e. higher level descriptions of data Meta-information - information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses; are these data products? Key contribution: Michener outlines some of the key criteria, challenges and opportunities for metadata within an ecological context. Notes on metadata: Some benefits of metadata include: Longevity of the data is greatly increased Reuse of the data both by the original researcher and others is facilitated Well-documented data may be used to expand scale of ecological inquiry The primary functionality of metadata is: Supports data discovery (most basic level) Facilitates the acquisition and use of data by humans (requires additional metadata) Enables automatic discovery, ingestion and analysis of data (requires more sophisticated metadata), which needs: research context (hypothesis, study site, experimental design, etc.) status of dataset physical structure of dataset info to facilitate use and comprehension Ecological Metadata Language (EML): EML is a standard for metadata that provides structure that supports automated functions of metadata listed above and is implemented in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Organized into modules, such as “dataset”, “access”, “physical”, “party coverage”, “project”, “methods”, “datatable”, “attribute”, and “physical” Additional info at ecoinformatics.org 6.1.4 Bekker et al, 2007 “Long term datasets: From descriptive to prescriptive data using ecoinformatics” (Bekker et al. 2007) Key contribution: This is the lead article to a special issue in Journal of Vegetation Science that focuses on ecoinformatics driven approaches to understanding complexity within vegetation systems. The article is less informative in its own right as much as a good pointer to other key studies working with vegetation science and ecoinformatics. It appears to be one of the earliest applications of ecoinformatics to vegetation science. Further reading: Le Duc, 2007 - A database application for long-term ecological field experiments Peacock, 2007 - The RAINFOR database, for monitoring forest biomass and dynamics 6.1.5 Hale &amp; Hollister, 2009 “Beyond data management: How ecoinformatics can benefit environmental monitoring programs” (Hale and Hollister 2009) Key contribution: This is a less seminal study. They describe the relevance of ecoinformatics for environmental monitoring, but do not go much beyond some of the other pieces on ecoinformatics and its relevance for ecology. Some relevant points that stood out to me: Standardization of taxonomic classes may be facilitated by ecoinformatics and application of ontologies in ecoinformatics Establishing standards and protocols can help in synthesizing studies and results across time and space Note: Likely better to focus on other studies within the literature than this one as they don’t bring up many points beyond those expressed in more seminal works. 6.1.6 Feller et al, 2010 “Biocomplexity in mangrove ecosystems” (Feller et al. 2010) Key contribution: Aim to elucidate the factors playing in at different hierarchical levels in mangrove ecosystems (biocomplexity). They use emergent properties (which they define as “patterns or processes that occur at multiple hierarchical levels within ecosystems”) to examine underlying ecological processes within mangroves. Biocomplexity appears to be thinking of ecology through a hierarchical lens, in which processes that exist at the “hard science” level (physics, chemistry, etc.) result in ecological processes &gt; functions &gt; services. Key findings: The article doesn’t differ much from other reviews of controls on mangrove processes, apart from the structure in which they examine: Controls of emergent properties (namely specializations for variable salinity, flooding and nutrient availability) e.g., salinity tolerance, flooding tolerance, reproductive traits/regeneration, nutrient availability perhaps analogous to “ecosystem processes” Collective properties of forests (e.g., zonation, productivity, nutrient cycling, food webs) perhaps analogous to “functions” Emergent/collective properties of ecosystems &amp; landscapes (e.g., habitat stability &amp; connectivity of ecosystems) perhaps analogous to “services” or “benefits” Emergent properties - concept that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts when examining ecological phenomena and the underlying processes that drive them. Emergent properties can exist at any scale, and may build upon themselves e.g., morphology and physico-chemical conditions leading to ecophysiology (emergent property) which then leads to spatial assemblages (2nd emergent property), etc.). it may be helpful to think of different emergent properties at different scales of time and space. Three primary characteristics of emergent properties exist: Emergent properties are not simply the sum of their parts Emergent properties exist as a type that is different from their underlying components They cannot be easily predicted from individual components Examples of emergent properties within mangroves are ecophysiological traits (as listed above) that emerge from the interaction between biochemical and morphological traits with environmental factors. Individual Based Models (IBMs) are discussed as useful though limited tools for examining biocomplexity within mangroves, but note that there is relatively little work in this field to date. See section 3.1.10 for an example of using IBMs within mangroves. 6.1.7 Michener &amp; Jones, 2012 “Ecoinformatics: Supporting ecology as a data intensive science” (Michener and Jones 2012) Key contribution: This is a seminal study on the relevance of ecoinformatics written by two of the leading thinkers in the field. Key notes: Several key notes from the study are: The authors describe the “data life cycle,”&quot; with 8 steps that do not necessarily occur in sequential order and depend upon the analysis and research question at hand: Plan - derive a data management plan that is often a living document as needs and uses for data will change over time Collect - there are highly variable mechanisms under which this occur given the vast amount of data types and collecting methods that exist; standardization in collection procedures is key for synthesizing data at later times Assure - measures taken to ensure data quality both before and after collection of the data; may consist of standardization of codes, units or metadata (e.g., using EML) Describe - sufficiently describing the data via metadata (who, what, when, where, why) Preserve - depositing of data in a repository such that they may be verified, maintained and accessed through time Discover - identifying appropriate data for research question of interest; double-edged sword in that you can get millions of hits or alternatively have tons of distinct data sources that exist only on disparate, local machines. DataONE is one such tool that drills down into data to identify datasets of actual interest; this is where ontologies come into play Integrate - understanding methodological differences, transforming to common representations and converting and recoding data to comparable semantics Analyze - reproducibility in analysis, with a particular focus on scientific workflows A schematic of the data life cycle that the authors provide is: DataONE: DataONE is a research platform that seeks to support the entire data life cycle, as well as integrate many different forms of data. There are three principle components: Member Nodes - contribute data, computing resources and services (e.g., data repositories, universities, computing centers) Coordinating Nodes - support network-wide services such as indexing, replication, and interactability of Member Nodes Investigator Toolkit - tools for researchers to employ in all steps of the data life cycle 6.1.8 Ruegg, 2014 “Completing the data life cycle: Using information management in macrosystems ecology research” (Rüegg et al. 2014) Key contribution: This article promotes the premise that macrosystem ecology requires integrated information management at its inception. In calling for “completing the data cycle,” they refer to well-documenting datasets such that data may be re-used to answer new and different questions from those that are conceived by those involved in the original projects. The article is largely an extension of Michener and Jones (2012), and argues largely for extensive documentation of datasets to enhance longevity. Key notes: The study notes several key areas within the data life cycle: Data collection: Incorporating information management early within the data collection process; critical to consider the structure and longevity of the dataset prior to collection such that it may be built upon and reused in the future Data integration (1): Integrating data from many sources. Currently integration is not possible through an automated manner, though tools exist to help in data integration Data integration (2): Integrating data from local observations to models and back requires unique considerations Must understand spatial resolution of different datasets (e.g., field and RS data). Spatial and temporal issues exist for interpolation of field (e.g., point) datasets. “Completing the data cycle”: Documenting well and sharing facilitate analysis. Tools that show full data provenance and work flow can be effective in showing the full analysis and collection of a particular dataset. 6.1.9 Soranno, 2014 “Cross-scale interactions: Quantifying multi-scaled cause – effect relationships in macrosystems” (Soranno et al. 2014) Key significance: This study calls for a need for more explicit investigation of cross scale interactions (CSIs) both in time and space. They lay out a framework for investigating CSIs that consists of: Conceptual mapping Construction of an appropriate database (ecoinformatics) Modeling strategies that specifically investigate interactions (e.g., interaction terms in hierarchical modeling). Notes: The authors define two primary types of cross scale interactions (CSIs). Interactions among driver variables at different spatial scales that influence a focal resonse variable Interactions between transport processes that link fine- and broad-scaled processes The authors explicitly model the interaction using Bayesian hierarchical models via an interaction term between regional and local driver variables. Steps for quantifying CSIs: Conceptual model of cross-scale relationships that explicitly considers interactions and interdependencies. Development of the conceptual model is key to the process and entails four key components: Identifying relevant spatial and temporal extents and resolutions of driver variables Considering the types of the interactions that are expected Determining whether relationships are linear or nonlinear Identifying critical assumptions and uncertainties that may generate additional testable hypotheses Compilation of multi-scaled, multi-themed databases Summarize independent variables at multiple scales Resolve differences in data resolution (ecoinformatics helpful here) Test for CSI as interaction term using hierarchical models Example provided by authors The authors exemplify these steps in examining P nutrient additions in lake ecosystems in the US. Specifically, they encounter the issue in that wetland cover surrounding lakes leads to both increases and decreases in concentrations of P. They hypothesize that there are interactive effects between agricultural presence and wetland presence on lake P, and model the cross spatial scale interactivity between the two as an interaction term. The results are significant and lead the authors to additional hypotheses. The particular case study is facilitated by standardization of lake environmental quality data. References "],
["ontologies.html", "6.2 Ontologies", " 6.2 Ontologies 6.2.1 Williams, 2006 “Ontologies for ecoinformatics” (Williams, Martinez, and Golbeck 2006) Key contribution: This is an early piece that gives an overview of what purpose ontologies may serve within ecology. They discuss it in particular relation to food webs within ecology, which are inherently complex with multiple definitions or system-specific interpretations for terms. Key notes: Ontologies should be employed to describe the following characteristics of a dataset: Where, when and by who the data are collected A description of what was observed, including identity and traits of the organism Sampling protocol, including collection procedures and associated experimental manipulations The architecture of the ontology can be designed intelligently such that the ontology is extensible, and allows for both system-specific interpretations as well as across-system relationships. For example, they discuss the importance of separating “entities” and “traits”. The piece by Madin, 2008 (see Section 6.2.3) provides a more comprehensive overview of ontologies within ecology and should be referred to in conjunction with this piece. 6.2.2 Madin, 2007 “An ontology for describing and synthesizing ecological observation data” (Madin et al. 2007) Key significance: Madin et al present a formal ontological framework within ecology (SEEK’s OBOE) that captures the essential semantic information of observational datasets, which will aid discovery and integration of data. The paper is structured: A discussion of ontologies and their relevance in ecology An introduction and overview of SEEK Extensible Observation Ontologies (OBOE) Several examples of use of OBOE for i) data discovery, ii) data summary, and iii) data integration Notes: Ontology - “A representation of the knowledge within a domain of interest, defined via the concepts within the domain as well as the properties and relationships among domain objects” The work of the authors of the study is founded within the SEEK project. SEEK aims to develop technology to discover, access, integrate and analyze distributed ecological information, primarily through extension of EML to support semantic annotation of ecological datasets. This is done primarily through OWL-DL (description logic) ontologies. Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) - aims to provide a core ontology framework for semantically annotating observational data sets. OBOE differs from other ecological ontologies in that it: Provides a robust framework for describing generic scientific observations Facilitates and structures the creation and sharing of domain-specific ontology extensions Provides discovery and integration services by semantic annotations to the ontology across variable domains of ecological observation data The core structure of OBOE is diagrammed below: The five key characteristics of OBOE are: Observations - formal statement that an entity of a particular type was observed Entities - all Observations are composed of exactly one Entity Measurements - Observations can be composed of Measurements, which represent measurable Characteristics of whatever entity is being observed Measurements are always associated with Observations Can have a variety of different characteristics, which are defined via the ofCharacteristic property Characteristics - “qualities” of the entity being observed Measurement standards - the units, scales, categories, catalogs and lists used when measuring characteristics. Two subclasses of Measurement standards exist: Entity naming standard - defines uniques names for unique identifies (e.g., “California”) Entity classification standard - entities associated with a classification have one or more instances (e.g., “red”, “5 m”) Additionally, for ratio or other complex units (e.g., ct / ha), the individual components may be assigned Measurement standards such that automatic conversions or data discovery may be performed. The different classes of the above can be used to describe the data, and facilitate machine-intelligent discovery, data summary and data integration. For example, data searches for density data may be able to identify datasets consisting of explicitly reported “density” data, as well as datasets that report the constituents of “density” (e.g., count &amp; area) 6.2.3 Madin, 2008 “Advancing ecological research with ontologies” (Madin et al. 2008) Key significance: This article gives an overview of ontologies in ecology, with particular focus on: What issue they are capable of resolving – i.e., integration of heterogeneous data What ontologies are and the forms they take Ongoing efforts to advance ontologies within ecology Ontologies provide a formal mechanism for defining terms and their relationships, and can improve the location, interpretation and integration of data based on its inherent meaning.&quot; The issue: Lack of critical consideration of “concepts” within ecology complicates interpretation and synthesis of findings, as well as the location and reuse of existing datasets. The solution: Ontologies provide a formal framework for establishing concepts within a discipline, and can resolve some of the issues that arise from multiple or nuanced interpretations of the same “concept” within ecology. Notes: Ontologies within ecology are becoming more common, with three particular trends emerging: Domain-specific ontologies that focus on capturing terminology used in specialized scientific disciplines or communities, for example: Ontologies in Web Ontology Language (OWL) for food-web networks that are described in Williams 2006 (see Section 6.2.1). Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) - Maintained by NASA JPL, use OWL ontologies to improve data integration and access capabilities. Framework ontologies that define general concepts and relationships that others can extend when building domain ontologies, for example: Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) - component of the SEEK project; basic concepts and relationships for describing observational datasets (e.g., field, experimental, simulation and monitoring data). Compatible with EML, and its core concepts (i.e., “Entity”, “Characteristic”, and “Measurement Standard”) can all be extended with domain-specific ontologies. Classes for Environmental Data Exchange (CEDEX) - formal framework for describing monitoring and experimental data from the European consortium of long-term ecological research stations. Observations Data Model (ODM) or the Open Geospatial Consortium’s Observations and Measurements model OGC O&amp;M - framework intended to facilitate the sharing and reuse of data within particular domains (hydrology projects for the first, geospatial work for the second); free-form extensibility of OBOE is not present. Other less formal approaches that identify and describe terms and concepts that are relevant to ecological research These commonly exist as thesauri that seek to standardize use of terms (and thus may aid in searching or browsing), but are not as effective as formal ontologies due to informal (and therefore a lack of logical relationships) nature. The authors provide a nice figure that exemplifies the architectural framework of responsible management and archiving of data: 6.2.4 Reichman, 2011 “Challenges and opportunities of open data in ecology” (Reichman, Jones, and Schildhauer 2011) Key significance: This piece focuses on how ecology (in some respects) has moved from a site-scale experimental field to one that is capable of large synthesis studies across broad spatial or temporal scales. They discuss issues of heterogeneity in data format and availability, and how to resolve them in order to perform synthetic analyses. Key notes: Reichman et al estimate that just 1% of ecological data that has been produced is available after publication of the associated results. They note three major technological challenges to “open data” (a la, Michiner, 2006), namely: Data dispersion - Decentralized existence across a broad range of databases (either local or online) Heterogeneity - Lack of consistency in collection, formatting and reporting Provenance - Issues of origin and history (relevant for datasets, as well as data products) Data dispersion: DataONE - A project designed to provide access to a number of central data repositories (e.g., Data Dryad) that facilitates data searching and access (also see Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)) Heterogeneity: Data heterogeneity unlikely to be resolved due to specific research objectives and logistical constraints. Use of structured metadata such as EML, however, is efficient at aiding access and reporting of heterogeneous data. Data provenance: Need scripted workflows that show quality control, processing and analysis of a dataset, particularly for derived datasets (e.g., meta-analyses or other secondary data objects) Unique identifiers (as DataONE) provides can be key for monitoring data provenance Social considerations: Social constraints to formalized sharing and archiving data are likely greater than the technical challenges. A formal reward system for promoting open access data may be key to advancing open data within ecology. 6.2.5 Wickham, 2014 “Tidy data” (Wickham and others 2014) Key significance: A formal description of Hadley’s “tidy data” concept. See also this online article, which is a bit more of a code-based explanation of tidy data. Key notes: Tidy data has the following fundamental format: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. Data tidying - as organizing datasets such to facilitate analysis In organizing data, there is a general rule of thumb that it’s easier to describe functional relationships between variables (i.e., linear combinations of columns) rather than relationships between observations (rows); AND it’s easier to compare across groups of observations (rows) relative to between groups of variables (columns) There are four basic verbs for data manipulation: Filter - subsetting or removing observations based on a condition Transform - adding or modifying variables Aggregate - collapsing multiple values into a single value Sort - changing the order of observations Tidy data is particularly useful for modeling, and is a large part of why it is designed/promoted.

["ecosystem-stability.html", "6.3 Ecosystem stability", " 6.3 Ecosystem stability 6.3.1 Scheffer, 2001 “Catastrophic shifts in ecosystems” (Scheffer et al. 2001) Key contribution: This article focuses on observed large-scale shifts in major ecosystems and their explanations. They provide both a theoretical framework for understanding catastrophic shifts, as well as an overview of results from different ecosystems with highlights of different patterns and implications for management. Key notes: Theoretical framework: Catastrophic shifts occur abruptly, and thus “early-warning signals” of approaching catastrophic change are difficult to gather. Conceptualization of ecosystem response curve as “folded backwards” implies that for certain environmental conditions, ecosystem may have two alternative stable states that are separated by an unstable equilibrium. The “catastrophic shift” is the point at which the bifurcation point is passed and the system shifts from a stable state to an unstable state or alternatively to an alternative stable state. This has large implications for the state at which a system exists in, as well as restorative action to return it to a desired state (as returning conditions to original state may not be sufficient). “Hysteresis” - memory of the system; the path back to a pre-existing state is not simply achieved through reversing the changes that brought about the shifts in states. “Resilience” - as defined by Holling is the size of the valley, or basin of attraction around a state, which corresponds to maximum perturbation that can be taken without causing a shift to an alt stable state. Gradually shifting environmental parameters may not induce a change in state, but may greatly impact the “resilience” of a particular basin of attraction. Examples: Lakes - One of the most common examples is loss of water clarity and vegetation due to eutrophication in shallow lakes. A threshold appears to exist in which below that, nutrients have no effect but above it they induce stark state shifts. Hysteresis can be exemplified here as reduction in nutrient concentrations is not sufficient to reduce vegetation and return clarity to lake water. Desertification - Presence of desert vs vegetated landscapes may be conceived of as alternative stable states. May occur through time as vegetation promotes more moist conditions and lack of vegetation promotes drier conditions. May have feedbacks with the climate in the Sahel region that produce alternating stable states. Emerging patterns The strongest cases for existence of alternative stable states are based on combinations of approaches, e.g., observations of repeated shifts, feedback mechanisms that maintain different states, or models showing mechanisms that plausibly explain field data. Contrasts in ecosystem states are commonly seen by shifts in dominance of organisms with different life forms. Feedbacks that stabilize different ecosystem states may involve biological, physical, and/or chemical mechanisms. Critically, invisible impacts, for example anthropogenic effects, may not induce state shifts but may greatly impact the resilience of particular alternative stable states. Management implications Resilience often depends on variables that change slowly over time, and thus may be more easily “managed”. Sharp perturbations are less predictable and thus are more difficult to manage. Thus, maintaining resilience is likely the most pragmatic means of managing ecosystems. Ultimately, this requires long-term monitoring of a variety of environmental parameters. Detection of EWS may be difficult and thus need long-term datasets to see changes in system behavior. 6.3.2 Beisner et al, 2003 “Alternative stable states in ecology” (Beisner, Haydon, and Cuddington 2003) Key significance: This article provides a nice review of the theory surrounding alternative stable states as they relate to ecology. Key notes: The idea is credited first to Lewontin, 1969, but two other seminal works are Holling, 1973 and May, 1977. Theoretical ecologists largely view alternative stable states and the pressures on the resilience of systems in two different conceptual ways: Different states exist simultaneously under same conditions and shifts between the two states are due to a sufficiently large perturbation (variable shifts) Change in the parameters that determine behavior of state variables and the ways they interact with each other (parameter shifts) generally occur due to shifts in environmental “drivers” influencing communities Variable shifts Perturbations to state variables commonly thought of via two separate “classes” of alternative stable states: Alternative interior states - involves nonlinearity in the transformation of the state such that multiple stable points exist within the system (local stability does not imply global stability) Incorporates boundary states (one or more species may be absent) - if systems of equations are linear, only one stable composition is possible with all species represented… but may have other stable points in which some of the species are missing. Shifts in parameters Parameters are defined as “environmental drivers”. Each state is considered stable but associated dynamics (local stability, population fluctuations) are different given that they correspond to different parameter values. Given that the “landscape” changes, not all potential alternative stable states exist may be present at all times. Hysteresis - the dependence of the state of a system on its history (i.e., memory); “hysteresis is revealed if the return trajectory of the equilibrium point differs from that adopted during its outward journey” &lt;- here the outward journey is influencing the system (i.e., it “remembers” its return) and thus it may be seen that the system exhibits a different return trajectory. 6.3.3 Biggs, 2009 “Turning back from the brink: Detecting an impending regime shift in time to avert it” (Biggs, Carpenter, and Brock 2009) Key contribution: This article examines the “timing” of an early warning signal. It is motivated under the premise that EWS may occur as a system approaches a bifurcation point, but it is unclear whether or not effective management action may be taken in time to avert a regime shift. They explore: How close ecosystems can get to ecological thresholds and still avert regime shifts Which regime shift indicators might give warning before “no point of return” Key notes: The underlying drivers that reduce resilience in systems are often associated with economic gains and thus there may be considerable long-term or short-term pressure on them. The findings indicate that if the pressure can be immediately reduced, then action even during the beginning stages of a regime shift might be effective enough to avert the actual shift, or prevent transitioning to alternative stable state. For pressures that take much longer to reduce, then action must be taken considerably before the regime shift begins to occur. EWS such as increases in variance, skewness, kurtosis and AR1 coefficient occur during “policy window” (i.e., the time in which action is still effective) for fast-actions, but only begin to occur after the policy window for slow actions has already closed. Regime shifts that occur through slow-change of underlying variables occur via bifurcations: small gradual changes can cause abrupt qualitative changes in long-term behavior due to appearance or disappearance of attractors. Key finding is that within environmental management, there are key windows in which action must be taken to avert shifts. The authors note that this window and the efficacy of different policies over time are rarely taken into consideration. In managing ecosystems, likely have variables that can be altered both quickly as well as those that change more slowly with time. Thus, may be able to “buy time” in altering the more reactive variables while progress is made on the slower-moving variables. Their findings show that some of the EWS indicators from Scheffer, 2009 might not be effective from a time-perspective. They use a spectral density ratio, which can be expressed in absolute terms and may be effective in identifying switches in attractors. Example provided by authors The authors provide an example of fisheries management, with different pressures that influence state variables at different time scales: Limit on how much fishing is allowed Preservation of sheltering habitat for juvenile piscivorous fish For the first, the time-scale over which it may take effect is much faster and thus may be able to use it to “buy time” or alter state conditions such that regime shifts are avoided. Given the time needed for the second (preserving sheltering habitat), the process is much slower and often times EWS may become apparent at too late of a time for changes in these variables to improve resilience and avoid a regime shift. 6.3.4 Scheffer, 2009 “Early-warning signals for critical transitions” (Scheffer et al. 2009) Key contribution: This paper follows up on Scheffer 2001 in that it addresses the issue of actually identifying early warning signals. The key issue here is predicting critical transitions, which is no easy task, may be facilitated by certain generic symptoms that occur as a system approaches a critical point. Key notes: One of the key ideas behind this article is that there are several “generic” early warning signals that are consistent across systems (finance, health, environment) that may be employed as indicators of potential regime shifts. This study reviews them here as well as provides several key examples. One other that they do not discuss but has shown up in other literature and may be relevant for intertidal ecosystems is: Self-organized patchiness (see Section 6.5.2). Bifurcations: Catastrophic bifurcations - once a threshold is exceeded, a positive feedback propels system through phase of directional change towards contrasting state. Other important bifurcations include those that mark transitions from stable equilibrium to cyclic or chaotic attractor. Theory: “Critical slowing down and its symptoms” - recovery rate of the system as it approaches a critical bifurcation can be used as an indicator of how close the system is to said bifurcation point. The rate of change is the criteria (approaches 0 with increasing proximity to critical bifurcation), and thus there is not a risk of pushing a system into an alternative stable state. Key symptoms are: Slowing down - slowing down leads to increase in autocorrelation in resulting pattern of fluctuations Increased autocorrelation - slowing down causes intrinsic rates of change to decrease, thus state of system increasingly resembles previous state (i.e., memory of system; can be seen through lag-1 autocorrelation) Increased variance - increased variance in pattern of fluctuations; given lagged response time, the effects of shocks become additive, increasing variance. Although it may be difficult to examine experimentally, we can use the presence of natural perturbations to examine recovery rate. “Skewness and flickering”: Skewness - asymmetry of fluctuations; characterized by the state existing in the unstable side of a bifurcation point longer than the stable side (refers to directionality of approach to bifurcation point) Flickering - occurs when stochastic forcing pushes the state back and forth between the basins of attraction; considered early warning because system may permanently shift to alternative stable state “Cyclic and chaotic systems” - may have transitions from stable systems to oscillatory systems; signaled by critical slowing down characterized by long transient oscillations “Spatial patterns as warning signals” - may have increased cross-correlation or spatial coherence among units before a critical event (e.g., presence of species in adjacent patch habitats) Examples: Climate is one of most commonly examined as a messy “real-world” system. Analyses indicate that EWS may exist for abrupt shifts in climate (from tropical to ice-age). For example, increases in autocorrelation have been found, as well as flicking prior to Younger Dryas cold period. 6.3.5 Boettiger, 2012 “Quantifying limits to detection of early warning for critical transitions” (Boettiger and Hastings 2012) Key significance: This paper discusses the uncertainty and failures of simple statistical means of EWS in alternative stable state theory. They make the case for a model-based approach, which can help alleviate many of the shortcomings of a purely statistical approach. Key notes: Summary statistics approach commonly employs increasing trend in summary stats such as variance, autocorrelation, skew, or spectral ratio. Shortcomings of summary stats approaches There are many hidden assumptions that occur with use of summary statistics. Variance may increase for reasons that do not signal approaching transition. Approaches based on increasing trends in summary stats assume a changing parameter has brought a system closer to a bifurcation. This assumption excludes at least three alternative explanations: A large perturbation of the system state has moved system to alternative basin of attraction this perturbation is exogenous to system and thus would not be expected to be predicted Purely noise-induced transition, chance fluctuation that happens to carry system across the boundary studies have shown it’s unlikely EWS are able to detect these System may pass through saddle-node bifurcation, but in rapid or highly nonlinear way making detection of gradual trends impossible. Given that we do not have replicate systems in which to examine EWS or regime shifts, often use shifting window applied to single replicate over time. This is an issue as selection of the window size and whether or how much to overlap are arbitrary decsisions. Quantitative measures of early warning patterns do not exist. Model-based approach Read once through, but confused by math… need to go back and read a second time. 6.3.6 Moffett, 2015 “Multiple stable states and catastrophic shifts in coastal wetlands: Progress, challenges, and opportunities in validating theory using remote sensing and other methods” (Moffett et al. 2015) Key contribution: This provides an overview of using remote sensing to examine different alternative stable states in coastal ecosystems. The article is potentially worth a second read, particularly the examples section in which they provide some details on systems outside of mangroves. Key notes: Applying multiple stable state theory “Multiple stable ecosystem states are created by coupled positive and negative feedbacks that link the ecological, hydrological and geomorphological processes in the coastal wetland environment in a self-reinforcing and relatively resilient manner” Alternative stable states in observation and management Several characteristics of alternative stable states make them difficult to observe: Impossible to uniquely define the system state with single observation points in time, but rather need knowledge of history of the system as well Practical issue of scale in a system with potential alternative stable states; thus, need observations that span both time and space Alternative stable states should give rise to two important and related phenomena: Tendency for contrasting states to persist simultaneously along sharp boundary despite gradual change in underlying environmental conditions (“self-organized ecosystem patterning”) May be induced by scale-dependent feedbacks Ability of system to rapidly and wholly switch from one broad ecosystem state to another (“catastrophic ecosystem shift”) Alternative stable states in mangroves “Runaway sedimentation” - One mechanism of forming alternative stable states in mangrove systems; as mangroves expand, they induce sedimentation that may eventually limit their expansion, and thus may reach a new stable state wherein the shoreline is no longer prograding Notion of alternative stable states may differ depending upon scale: At ecosystem scale may be cosnidered as mangroves vs. other coastal vegetated ecosystems Alternatively may also consider patch occurrence of different mangrove species or zonation References "],

Key notes: “Resilience thinking” (perspective): provides integrated perspective for analysis that emphasizes nonlinearities within a system as well as interdependency of social and ecological systems emphasizes interface of gradual changes with punctuated disturbances, feedbacks, alternative stable states, cross-scale relationships &amp; regime shifts “Resilience” - capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize under change such that it restores its fundamental function, structure, identity and feedbacks “Optimisation for conservation” (tool): An “outcome-oriented tool” that functions under resource scarcity to promote rational and transparent decision making Integrating the two: Given that one is a perspective and the other is a tool, they may be relevant at different stages of a project or research program and thus may be integrated relatively efficiently Resilience thinking may be particularly useful in defining boundaries of a system (spatial and temporal scales as well as key actors or variables in a system) particular importance is involvement of key actors due to focus on social-ecological system thresholds are unknown thus may be seen as working hypotheses that are updated with new information Thus, optimal solution is an interative process and may potentially change given new insights The authors identify three themes worth particular attention: Addressing social issues Addressing uncertainties and interface with decision-making Avoiding undesirable states that constrain reversibility Social issues Optimization may be well suited to handle some social issues (e.g., easily quantified finances), but less so for factors that are not easily quantified (human values, cultural practices). Can use optimization as part of social or political framework and analyze for lessons learned to understand these less-easily quantified factors, however. Uncertainties Uncertainties are common within social ecological systems and greatly complicate optimization techniques. “Novel ecosystems” or co-occurrence of two or more species in a single place and time represents one such uncertainty-laden situation. Resilience thinking may help promote more effective science and management around such situations, for example focusing on “drivers” rather than “patterns”. Avoiding undesirable states Key challenge is to maintain desirable states and avoid undesirable ones that are difficult to get out of. Social factors can complicate things that may otherwise appear straightforward to optimize. For example: Protection of reserves may appear straight forward at first, but may not respond to climate change or other shifting environmental parameters Use of corridors or other connectivity networks thus may be important, but ultimately may not account for social, economic or political factors that impact the efficacy of connectivity plans Ultimately need to consider conservation efforts both inside as well as outside the reserves, as well as the key social factors that impact them 6.4.2 Folke et al, 2010 “Resilience thinking: Integrating resilience, adaptability and transformability” (Folke et al. 2010) Key significance: This study reviews resilience thinking and describes the concepts of “resilience”, “adaptability”, and “transformability” as they relate to it. Prompted largely by the issue in that dynamical systems theory doesn’t necessarily account for inherent dynamism in systems in that they change naturally over time. Key notes: “Resilience” as applied to ecological systems original came from Holling, 1973 and was related to capacity of a system to respond to stressors and yet retain underlying function, structure and characteristics. “Regime shifts”&quot; become “critical transitions” when a system passes to a different stable domain. One of main limitations of dynamical systems theory is that they do not account for fact that underlying nature of systems may change with time. Thus, understanding of social-ecological systems requires other concepts. Adaptability and transformability “Adaptability” - capacity of actors in a system to influence resilience “Transformability” - defined as capacity to create a fundamentally new structure when ecological, economic or social structures make existing system untenable Interface between the two and resilience is complex. Strategies that increase adaptability for socially desirable qualities may increase vulnerability of social-ecological systems to undesirable states. Specified vs. general resilience “Specified resilience” - resilience in reference to particular aspects or components of a system that may respond to a particular set of sources or shocks; “resilience of what, to what?” “General resilience” - resilience in reference to all sorts of shocks; coping with uncertainty in all ways Important to consider both, as often times one things in terms of specified resilience and thus may not be considering important or unexpected shocks. Tranformability and resilience at multiple scales Transformability may occur slowly as a result of underlying factors, or may be deliberately induced by social actions. Oftentimes, large-scale transformations of a system are too complex or expensive to perform, but sequential actions can allow for feedbacks that move a system towards another, as well as learning processes as decisions are made. Case studies of social ecological systems suggest transformations occur through three phases: Being prepared for or even preparing the social ecological system for change Navigating transition by making use of crisis as a window of opportunity for change Building resilience of new social-ecological regime Questions for consideration: Are there deeper, slower variables in social systems, such as identity, core values, and worldviews that constrain adaptability? What are the features of agency, actor groups, social learning, networks, organizations, institutions, governance structures, incentives, political and power relations or ethics that enhance or undermine social ecological resilience? How can we assess social ecological thresholds and regime shifts and what governance challenges do they imply? 6.4.3 Polasky et al, 2011 “Decision-making under great uncertainty: Environmental management in an era of global change” (Polasky et al. 2011) Key contribution: This article discusses the difficulty of environmental management under the pervasive uncertainties that exist due to global change. The authors review several strategies for informed decision-making that may help to alleviate challenges due to uncertainty. Key notes: The authors note that it is important to consider the potential for learning from decisions in addition to the potential impacts that may happen. Decisions that are made should be made such that they will inform iterative management as addtional understanding is achieved. In the authors view, ideal decision-making approaches should clarify the effect that alternative decisions have on probable desirability of outcomes in terms of stated objectives. Decision theory: “Decision theory” requires information about probabilities of various outcomes under alternative management options, as well as the desirability of those outcomes. In standard decision theory: Uncertainty is represented by assuming many different states of the system, as well as the various probabilities that each of those outcomes will occur Outcomes are joint products of action and state, which produces a conditional probability of outcomes given the action The outcomes are expressed in common metrics, and general best “decision” is the one that maximizes the “utility” of an action Advantage of standard decision theory is that it provides a clear and repeatable framework for generating a course of action that is based on empirical data. Disadvantage is that the necessary data (i.e., all alternative states) is unlikely to exist. Incorporating learning into the decision-making process may be one means of mitigating the lack of data: “forward-looking decision makers should take account of how current decisions might influence future conditions, future decisions and the probable impacts of decisions on current and future well-being.” Idea that “decision-making” should be treated as an experiment. Alternative methods to use beside decision theory: Thresholds approach - focus attention on critical boundaries that may lead to persistence of a new alternative state (often times with major consequences) Common example is the 2 degrees celsius threshold thought to be catastrophic GHG emissions. Thresholds are rarely ever precisely known, and thus each action incorporates a certain degree of risk with it. Decision-making ultimately needs to decide on what levels of risk are acceptable. In this context – those in power are ultimately deciding that the risks currently seen by climate change are “fine”. Scenario planning - thinking creatively and systematically about complex futures. Scenario planning does not incoporate probabilities, but rather models and explores potential alternative outcomes supported by data and simulations. Scenario planning can be helpful in conceptualizing the future. The key weakness of scenario planning is it is difficult to assess the likelihood of any given scenario occurring. Resilience thinking - focuses on critical thresholds for system performance, as well as the capacities to both adapt and shift to a new system should a former one become untenable. Employs methods that use multiple perspectives to better-understand and identify uncertainty (similar to scenario planning). Resilience thinking requires an iterative approach, as assumptions and actions are re-evaluated with increasing availability of information (i.e., “adaptation”). Decision making for global change Standard decision making theories will fail as likelihoods of alternative states are likely to be too subjective and will induce disagreement such that decisions are ultimately not taken. The alternative methods proposed in the study may be one route by which decision-making can be informed, without the necessity of assigning probabilities to particular outcomes or actions. Decision-making around global change may be thought of as two phases with continuous feedbacks: Scoping the problem as broadly as possible to expand imaginable states and outcomes “Scenario planning” and “resilience thinking” can be effective here Actually making decisions given current understanding “Threshold approach” given that science often more robust in identifying vulnerabilities than predicting future 6.4.4 Johnson et al, 2017 “Knowing when (not) to attempt ecological restoration” (Johnson et al. 2017) Key significance: This opinion piece examines the critical questions of: How do we identify when community change represents a phase shift to a different ecological dynamic that warrants considering restoration? How do we identify discontinuous phase shift and hysteresis that may render futile attempts at restoration? Key notes: Ecosystems are dynamic and thus it is critical to understand and recognize change when considering or assessing the health or state of an ecosystem. This largely will have impacts on whether or not restoration attempts should be undergone. The authors lay out two key considerations that must be undertaken prior to restoration: Must interpret ecological change; typical fluctuations represent a properly functioning ecosystem that does not warrant restoration, whereas other less typical fluctuations may indicate loss of resilience or regime shift Ecological change may involve hysteresis and thus consideration as to whether or not restoration will be effective must be taken Characteristic length scale - spatial scale at which deterministic trends in ecological dynamic are most sharply in focus CLS can be particularly useful for interpreting change in an ecological system. Estimating CLS is based on the idea in that dynamic of an entire community can be approximated by dynamic of a single species given that the species is part of some larger network in the community. In the case in which the attractor (mathematically, the set of numerical values) of the system does not change, can understand fluctuations in the single species to be representative of the community; however, if the attractor changes then the CLS will change. “Phase space” - is space in which all possible states of the system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to a unique point in the phase space Exemplifying species invariance The study shows, for the first time, that in real ecological systems the selection of particular species does not matter and is representative of broader trends of that network within a community. Although the exact methods are a bit unfamiliar to me, they use predictions of a time series compared with the actual time series to quantify error, and use an inflection point at which the error “levels off” as the CLS. They investigate this via a marine fouling community, and show that 9 of 10 species are indicative of that network community, whereas the last has different ecology and is understood to be part of a different network. The significance here is that the findings adhere to theory (that selection of species does not matter), as well as the fact that CLS can be estimated using short time series of data Hysteresis example In regards to hysteresis and the point of whether or not to undertake restoration, they provide an example of sea urchins, kelp beds, and lobsters in eastern Tasmania. In urchin barrens, freezes on lobster harvesting or planting of kelp are unlikely to restore the system, thus restoration action is not being undertaken. Rather, resources are being put towards conservation of existing kelp beds through regulation of lobster harvesting in these spatially explicit areas. The management actions are a result of understanding the dynamics of key species and functional groups rather than comprehensive understanding of every component of the system. References "],

Key notes: Distribution modeling has informed hypotheses that mangroves and salt marshes exist due to thresholds at northern limits of mangrove range as a result of climatic variables. The study employs long-term satellite data coupled with historical temperature data spanning the coast of Florida to examine growth in extent of mangrove forest. Key results: Mangrove area within the band at the upper range of its limits (29 - 29.75 deg N) doubled over the 28 year period. Latitude 26.75 deg N existed as a breakpoint, in which areas north of that experience significant expansion and areas south of that did not experience significant expansion in extent. Expansion of mangroves, however, was not significantly associated with changes in mean annual or mean winter temperatures. It is unclear to me how exactly they distinguished between mangrove and other vegetation. They simply assume photosynthetic vegetation is mangroves but its possible it may have been another ecosystem type… 6.5.2 Eslami-Andergoli, 2015 “Approaching tipping points: A focussed review of indicators and relevance to managing intertidal ecosystems” (Eslami-Andergoli et al. 2015) Key contribution: This article reviews alternative stable state theory and early warning signals, with a particular focus on how it relates to intertidal ecosystems. They note the potential relevance of remote sensing as well as paleoecology &amp; soil stratigraphy for understanding long-term shifts in regime over time. Key notes: The authors suggest three primary ways in which alternative stable state theory can be examined within intertidal systems: Retrofitting data from long-term studies (i.e., coupling with external data sets to examine perturbations, shifts in state variables, and regime shifts) Using remote sensing to predict regime shifts Use paleoecological data to reconstruct developmental history of intertidal wetlands They focus largely on gradually changing state variables rather than sharp perturbations, as slow changes are most relevant for management practices. They note the potential relevance of spatial datasets for understanding tipping points, as they may help identify autocorrelation or state changes. For example, Dale and Dale 2002 use transition matrix to examine shifts in salt marsh plant communities over time, with permanent shifts potentially indicative of a tipping point. In identifying EWS in intertidal systems, the scale at which one is considering things is important. Role of vegetation versus shifts in hydrology or sedimentation may have different impacts at different scales. Often may consider shifting expanse of mangroves and loss of sea grass habitat. Challenges for indicators The authors identify several key limitations for using indicators to indicate impending transitions: Insufficient data or resolution within the data Inaccurate or imprecise observation Occurrence of large perturbation without any indication of EWS Interactions of multiple tresholds and correlated process errors may obscure EWS Systematic change in external perturbation regime over period leading to a shift Uncertainty involved in identifying and modelling dynamic processes Proposed EWS might not be detectable in some types of transition Underlying stochasticity that is always present in a system, even given shifts in state variables They make a call for long term monitoring, both from a field perspective as well as leverating remote sensing. 6.5.3 Ellison, 2015 “Vulnerability assessment of mangroves to climate change and sea-level rise impacts” (Ellison 2015) Key significance: The study reviews vulnerability of mangroves to climate change, and in particular sea level rise, and performs a study in which they seek to assess and measure vulnerabilities across mangrove sites in the Pacific with an end-goal of informing management of these systems. Key notes: Vulnerability as defined by Ellison has three components: Exposure to stress Associated sensitivity Related adaptive capacity For mangroves, exposure to stress is dependent upon different hydrogeomorphological setting, but is perhaps most broadly impacted by sea level rise. Exposure is largely related to shifts in external influences that impinge upon the health of the system. Sensitivity relates more to the resilience of the system and is a function of characteristics of species or the system as a whole. Vulnerability may be shown by decline in condition, productivity, biodiversity or increase in mortality. Adaptive capacity may be expressed in mangroves by retreat inland. If sediment accretion rates cannot keep up with sea level rise, then migration is key adaptation response and is dependent upon suitable topography and available areas. Vulnerability rankings Studies have tried to rank vulnerabilities of different ecosystems and the factors that drive them, and mangrove and unconsolidated sedimentary shores or coastal wetlands have been ranked as having high vulnerability. Assessing vulnerability of multiple mangrove sites globally The study examined mangrove sites in Eastern Africa, Western Africa, and the Pacific Islands to attain measurements of vulnerability and inform management. The vulnerability assessment methodology seeks to identify aspects that may already be experience climate change impacts and may also be more susceptible to future impacts. The assessments considers range of metrics within the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity categories. In distributing vulnerabilities amongst each of these categories, appropriate management options (a la Johnson, 2017) that are effective may be identified. Sea level rise, for example, may not be able to be controlled whereas barriers to forests migrating inland may be removed via land planning. The framework is generalized and allows for application at a broad range of sites. It incorporates both quantitative and qualitative metrics of vulnerability for the various sites. 6.5.4 Sasmito, 2016 “Can mangroves keep pace with sea level rise? A global data review” (Sasmito et al. 2016) Key contribution: This is a well-written study that looks at data of relative sea level rise and accretion rates in mangroves and assesses the abundance of empirical evidence indicating whether or not mangroves may keep pace with sea level rise.

Key notes: There are a number of relevant points in the paper, but of particular interest is the section entitled “Heterogeneity among mangrove communities – variation over tens of kilometres”. In particular, this section has relevance for the RSE paper with Iryna, as the author discusses analyses of spatial geometry for better understanding processes and functioning within mangrove systems. She cites several studies that may be of interest for looking into further: MacArthur &amp; Wilson, 1967 - The theory of island biogeography Burrough, 1983 - Multiscale sources of spatial variation in soil.

Application of fractal concepts to nested levels of soil variation Krummel et al 1987 - Landscape patterns in a disturbed environment Kolasa, 1989 - Ecological systems in hierarchical perspective: Breaks in community structure and other consequences Holling, 1992 - Cross-scale morphology, geometry, and dynamics of ecosystems *** Furthermore, the author notes that mangrove are particularly well-suited to such analyses, as component species are easily distinguished and mapped at multiple scales, and “islands of a wide range of sizes, shapes, and species composition are available for study.” A nice conceptual diagram of different ecosystem processes in mangroves across different scales is provided: Much of the paper focuses on different spatial scales, but they also note the importance of temporal scales at the end, with particular emphasis on the importance of defining the appropriate boundaries for the study of interest at a given time. 7.1.2 Alongi et al, 1992 “Nitrogen and phosphorus cycles” Key contribution - This chapter is an overview of N and P cycles in mangroves from the Tropical Mangrove Ecosystems book. Nitrogen The various pools of N in mangroves are characterized as follows: Waters - Dissolved organic N (DON) is primary form of N in mangrove ecosystems. Dissolved inorganic N is relatively low, with most of the inorganic form represented by ammonium and lesser amounts of nitrate and nitrite. Relatively little temporal and spatial variation in DON due to refractory nature of DON. Sediments - Dissolved inorganic N is low in mangrove sediments, whereas DON is high; In general rates of ammonium uptake by mangrove trees exceeds regeneration rates. Adsorption of ammonium to sediments has been shown to be low in silt-dominated sites Concentrations of total extractable N vary with sediment type and are correlate with distributions of fine roots (often highest at 20-40 cm interval) Transformation of N Bacterioplankton activities are believed to be major pathway of organic N transformation to ammonium, but as of 1992 the process had not been quantified. Immobilization (reincorporation of N into biomass) is primarily driven by the C:N ratio of decomposing organic matter. Given the relatively high C:N ratio of mangrove tree litter biomass, likely have significant rates of N immobilization within sediments. Nitrification - occurs close to sediment-water interface in oxidized linings of animal burrows or the rhizosphere. Performed by microorganisms; Nitrate is relatively short-lived in soil environment as it is taken up by plants or involved in other chemical reactions. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction - process in which nitrate serves as the electron accepter in respiration of anaerobic bacteria (reduced to nitrite). The reduction of nitrate to nitrite in mangroves is significant, and an additional step that results in reduction of nitrite to ammonium occurs (see Fernandes 2012). Denitrification - conversion of nitrate to N2 and N2O gases occurs, but may be most prominent in polluted sites. N fixation - carried out by bacteria and cyanobacteria; cyanobacterial mats on exposed sediments or associated with AG roots are primary location of N-fixing activity. Rates of fixation largely related to abundance of cyanobacteria Phosphorus Pools of P Waters - dissolved organic and inorganic P are low in mangroves; dissolved inorganic P exists primarily as a salt HPO42-. Availability of P in waters may be either dissolved in water column or bound to sediments in highly depositional settings. Sediments - Limited data as of 1992, but results indicate low dissolved P availability; total concentrations are relatively high however given high organic matter contents. - although organic P is largest pool, inorganic P is most readily available pool; most is bound in form of Ca, Al, or Fe phosphates - organic pools represent influence of roots whereas inorganic pools (mostly Fe-P) increase with depth as result of anoxia Transformation Transformation of P can be described primarily as biotic (assimilation, excretion, hydrolysis) or abiotic pathways (precipitation, adsorption and chemisorption, and dissolution and desorption) Kaolite clays are particularly efficient at absorbing phosphates and thus precipitation of phosphates with Ca, Fe, Al, or clays results in large removal of soluble phosphates to the mineral pool. A diagram of the Phosphurus cycle in mangroves is shown below: Uptake by organisms - bacteria, algae, and higher plants take up dissolved orthophosphate or organic phosphates (which may alternatively be hydrolyzed first) Sediment/water exchange of P &amp; N Little empirical work has been performed on this as of 1992, but data indicate that fluxes from the sediment (benthos) to water (pelagic) systems is small. Detritus decomposition Majority of detritus in mangroves is from within the system. Important considerations for decomposition of mangrove detritus are: High content of lignocellulose results in relatively slow decomposition Avicennia litter decomposes quite quickly as it is more nutritionally available Nitrogen is almost entirely conserved (100% concentration) of original litter during decomposition Occurs through different phases: loss of water-soluble compounds, microbial colonization and utilization, and mechanical fragmentation References "],
["pseudoreplication.html", "7.2 Pseudoreplication", " 7.2 Pseudoreplication 7.2.1 Hurlbert, 1984 “Pseudoreplication and the design of ecological field experiments” (Hurlbert 1984) Key significance: This seminal article outlines the risks of pseudoreplication in ecology, with specific examples from the literature. Key notes: The five key steps of the research process are: Hypothesis formulation Experimental design Experimental execution Statistical analysis Interpretation Experimental execution is highly prone to induced errors from systematic bias, and are an important component of assessing the validity and quality of an experiment. Experimental design is defined as the “logical structure of the experiment”. Hurlbert outlines two different classes of experiments: Mensurative experiments - involve making measurements at one or more points in space and time, and thus “space” or “time” is the only “experimental” variable or “treatment”. Assuring replicate samples or measurements are dispersed in space (or time) in a manner appropriate to specific hypothesis is most critical aspect od design of a mensurative experiment Pseudoreplication often a consequence of actual physical space over which samples are taken being smaller or more restricted than inference space implicit in the hypothesis being tested. Manipulative experiments - always involves two or more treatments, and has as its goal the making of one or more comparisons. Different experimental units receive different treatments and assignment of treatments to experimental units is or can be randomized. Pseudoreplication most commonly results from inferential statistics on experimental design in which treatments are not replicated, or replicates are not statistically independent. Pseudoreplication as Hurlbert defines it is “the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered.” Thus, it is a combination of experimental design as well as analysis that results in the issues (improper design and analysis pairing). Critical features of controlled experiments Hurlbert outlines 6 potential sources of confusion in controlled experiments: Temporal change Procedure effects Experimenter bias Experimenter-generated variability (random error) Initial or inherent variability among experimental units Intrusion - either potentially foreseen or chance events that impinge upon an experiment in progress; chance events occur in all experiments and add to “noise” replication and interspersion of treatments provide the best insurance against chance events Primarily four critical features of experimental design reduce the influence of these sources of confusion: controls, replication, randomization and interspersion. Randomized block design Allows for insurance against non-demonic intrusion as the block design explicitly introduces a certain degree of interspersion. Block designs may look like 4 different blocks with two plots in each block, and one of two treatments assigned randomly to one plot in each block. Systematic design May be helpful in mandating interspersion so long as cyclical variation in environmental variables does not co-occur with the systematic layout. Randomization vs. interspersion Argument largely held by Fisher and Gossett over randomized versus systematic layouts within experimental designs. Fisher maintained that interspersion was a secondary concern and should never be pursued at expense of exact knowledge of alpha. Prelayout alpha - probability, averaged over all possible layouts of a given experiment, of making a type I error (false positive) Layout-specific alpha - probability of making a type I error if a particular layout is used The issue is that the layout-specific alpha is of primary concern given the presence of only one experimental design in most cases, and yet it is never exactly known or specified. Depending on the degree of interspersion and environmental gradients, layout-specific alpha will relate to the prelayout alpha in a predictable manner (less dispersion, LS alpha &gt; PL alpha; more dispersion, LS alpha &lt; PL alpha). Typically want PL alpha (the specified criteria) to act as an upper bound on LS alpha. Statistical consequences Simple pseudoreplication is the most fundamental form of pseudoreplication and refers to the case in which replicates are considered within experimental units rather than as individual experimental units. In using replicates from within an experimental unit, one erroneously increases the degrees of freedom and reduces the variance (as additional samples from within a unit will come to more fully represent that unit) of statistical analyses. This makes it much easier to falsely reject the true null hypothesis (Type I error; false positive). References "],

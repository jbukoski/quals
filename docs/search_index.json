The crux of the idea here is that mangrove geomorphology in an applied sense exists largely through nominal definitions, when in actuality there is high heterogeneity within many of the various classes. I will review the literature surrounding mangrove geomorphology from a historical perspective, identify key factors to be quantified or monitored, and look at potential remote sensing applications that exist today, or will be coming online in the next 5 to 10 years. Target journal: Remote Sensing of Environment Coauthors: Iryna Dronova (UCB LAEP); Marc Simard (NASA JPL)?? MDP Research questions: What are the existing applications of remote sensing data to hydrology and sedimentary processes in mangrove ecosystems to date? Given new RS data types and their applications in fields outside of mangrove ecology, what opportunities for mapping and better-understanding mangrove geomorphology exist? Given new RS data types and their applications…, what challenges for mapping and better-understanding mangrove geomorphology exist? Abstract: For mangrove restoration and conservation projects, it is critical to understand the relationships between mangrove tree species and the geomorphological conditions in which they exist, as well as how they vary over time. While remote sensing of mangrove vegetation is commonplace within the academic literature, fewer studies employ remote sensing to study mangrove geomorphology. The use of remote sensing offers a valuable means to understand mangrove geomorphology at various temporal and spatial scales, as field studies of mangrove hydrology and sedimentary processes are complex and difficult. Given the rapid development of remote sensing technology, a thorough examination of the existing techniques and best practices for better understanding mangrove geomorphology is warranted. Thus, we present here a review of remote sensing of geomorphological processes in mangroves. Our review shows that use of remote sensing to monitor mangrove geomorphology has largely been limited to studies of shoreline erosion and progradation over the past few decades. Increasingly available new data sources such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral datasets, however, are providing access to novel and informative data layers, such as topography at fine resolutions and total suspended sediment. Leveraging future advances in remote sensing to better monitor mangrove geomorphology will be important for conserving these ecosystems, particularly given increasing global pressures from coastal development and sea level rise.

I currently envisage this as testing for correlations between soil organic carbon stocks and forest biomass, structure, and species composition properties. I am working on building a database for mangroves of the Americas with a URAP student that parallels the one I built for Southeast Asia during my master’s work, and am interested in testing the same models on the new dataset. I am also considering getting another URAP student to begin compiling a database for Africa / the middle East, which is the other major region for mangroves. One valuable product would be a comprehensive database of mangrove forest structure and soil characteristics data, with checks on how comparable the different sampling methodologies, datasets, etc. are. Target journal: TBD Coauthors: TBD Research questions: Basal area and latitude were found to be significant predictors of soil organic carbon in mangroves of Southeast Asia when controlling for site-specific effects (e.g., geomorphology). Are the results reproducible in the Americas, a mangrove region that is floristically less diverse than Southeast Asia? Same for Africa / Mid East. Note: If I am successful in constructing a database of forest structure, species, etc. from the literature, there are many other research questions that can be explored, such as: Examining effects of sea level rise or tidal range on mangrove structure &amp; species assemblages. RS studies such as discrimination of mangrove species or looking at geomorphology (RS data permitting) This might be difficult, though, as authors may not be forthcoming with data. "],

["zonation.html", "3.1 Zonation &amp; disturbance", " 3.1 Zonation &amp; disturbance 3.1.1 Preface Establishment of monospecific stands of mangrove trees in zones parallel to shorelines (zonation) has been among the most well-studied phenomenon in mangroves. Physicochemical gradients exist from the shoreward to landward edges of the intertidal zone, with implications for the recruitment, establishment, and dominance of different mangrove tree species. Several hypotheses attempting to explain zonation in mangroves have existed throughout time: Zonation as mangrove succession - Davis, 1940: From his work in Florida, Davis believed that mangroves promoted shoreline progradation, which was followed by establishment of Avicennia germinans species in the most seaward portion of the intertidal zone. Eventually Rhizophora mangle with a few Laguncularia racemosa individuals would outcompete A. germinans as the shore (and thus habitat for A. germinans) continued to prograde. Davis believed that the zones of species were a successional process, eventually climaxing in a terrestrial forest dominated by non-mangrove species. Zonation as response to geomorphic condition - Thom, 1967: Thom did his field work in a composite lagoon and riverine system in Tabasco, Mexico, and provided one of the first most comprehensive sets of evidence against Davis’s hypothesis of zonation as mangrove succession. In looking at the different habitats in which mangrove tree species existed, Thom concluded that zonation of species was in response to the hydrological and substratum conditions of a site, which were ultimately variables controlled by geomorphic processes. As a result, he concluded that spatial patterns of mangrove species were in response to geomorphic changes in the land rather than mangrove species inducing patterns in geomorphology (and thus species zonation was relatively “stable”). Zonation as adaptation to physico-chemical gradients - Macnae, 1968: Zonation as result of interspecific competition - Clarke and Hannon, 1971: Zonation due to tidal sorting of propagules - Rabinowitz, 1978: Upon investigating no significant difference in survival and growth rates of Avicennia, Rhizophora, Laguncularia, and Pelliciera tree individuals planted in monospecific stands in Panama, Rabinowitz concluded that mangrove zonation is not primarily controlled by physiological variables. In response, she hypothesized that the zonation of species may be due to differences in propagule size and weight between species. The hypothesis posits that differences in size and weight have enabled species to establish in areas with different tidal regimes (smaller propagules in shoreward zones, larger propagules in landward zones). Rabinowitz provides a discussion of the hypothesis and identifies several other studies that may support the hypothesis. Zonation as result of differential predation on propagules - Smith, 1987: Several comprehensive reviews of zonation in mangroves are provided in: Lugo and Snedaker, 1974 (Reviewed in this chapter) Smith, Forest Structure (In Robertson and Alongi, 1992) 3.1.2 Thom, 1967 “Mangrove ecology and deltaic geomorphology: Tabasco, Mexico” (Thom 1967) Key contribution: Thom’s work in the lagoons and riverine settings (“composite river &amp; wave-dominated”) of Tabasco, Mexico was one of the most well-cited examples against Thom’s hypothesis of mangrove succession. In looking at the different hydrological regimes and substratum of various mangrove “zones,” he concluded that mangrove zonation in species was in response to geomorphic condition and was relatively stable in time (as opposed to altering landscapes and facilitating succession). The following chart details the presence of different stand types within the geomorphic settings of Tabasco, Mexico. Key findings: Thom’s findings provided evidence that: mangroves establish in areas of natural accreting soil, but facilitate accretion of soil upon establishment (e.g., Rhizophora choking creeks &amp; channels). mangroves are opportunistic in their establishment, largely responding to geomorphic conditions Further reading: 1. Thom 1982 - Identification of five geomorphic clastic settings 2. Thom 1984 - Identification of three geomorphic carbonate settings 3.1.3 Lugo &amp; Snedaker, 1974 “The ecology of mangroves” (Lugo and Snedaker 1974) Key contribution: Lugo and Snedaker’s seminal work on the ecology of mangroves (in Florida) is most commonly cited for their definition of six mangrove forest types: Fringe forest - Mangrove assemblages that are found on the fringes of sheltered coastlines. Zonation in species typically follows Davis’s patterns. Riverine forest - Tall forests found in floodplains and along riverine systems of deltas and estuaries. These may occur in conjunction with “fringe forests,” are tidally flushed, yet have more complex hydrological influences from upland, freshwater sources. Overwash forest - Forest types often consisting of Rhizophora species over low islands or small projections in bays and estuaries that are only inundated with high tides. Basin forest - Mangrove assemblages that occur in the “basins” in between tidal channels and distributaries. Often among the most extensive sections of mangrove forests and may exhibit zonation with changes in elevation as the landward zone of the forest is reached. Hammock forest - A variant of the basin forest occuring in fringe forests in areas of raised topography. Dwarf forest - Mangrove forests that occur along flat coastal fringes and are stunted in growth (height) due to nutrient limitations. In addition, Lugo and Snedaker provide a review of matter cycling in mangroves; however, more recent reviews of the topic have been written and should be referred to. Lugo and Snedaker provide a conceptual model of energy flows in mangroves (below), although it may be slightly over simplified. 3.1.4 Rabinowitz, 1978a “Dispersal properties of mangrove propagules” (Rabinowitz 1978a) Key contribution: This paper provides a review of propagule physiology and establishment for six species from Panama (L. racemosa, A. germinans, A. bicolor, R. mangle, R. harisonii, and P. rhizophorae). Rabinowitz reviews the different anatomy and physiology of the four genera, and then provides results from experiments on dispersal characteristics such as time of floatation, time to rotting and time to establishment. Key knowledge: Mangroves are viviparous in that propagules go from parent tree to embryonic stage to establishment continuously without a “dormant” period. Propagules often sprout roots during the dispersal stage, which aids in their establishment. Key finding: After her experiments, Rabinowitz found that smaller propagules from Avicennia and Laguncularia were less capable of sinking or establishing underwater, and thus are more likely to be limited to higher areas with periodic absences of tidal inundation (where they are characteristically found). The larger propagules of Rhizophora and Pelliciera are capable of sinking and establishing underwater, and thus are not limited in areas of establishment. 3.1.5 Rabinowitz, 1978b “Early growth of mangrove seedlings in Panama, and an hypothesis concerning the relationship of dispersal and zonation” (Rabinowitz 1978b) Study design: Examined growth and survival of R. harisonii. A. sps, L. racemosa, and P. rhizophorae in each of four monospecific parent swamps in different locations of Panama (i.e., four parent stands at each of four sites). Gardens of each of the four species were planted and examined for growth and survival to see if seedlings fared better in stands of their parent species. Key findings: Rabinowitz examined establishment of four different genera (Avicennia, Laguncularia, Pelliciera, and Rhizphora) in stands of both their parent genus as well as others. Her findings were primarily: seedlings generally grew better in habitats of other mangroves than in own parents habitat growth of seedling largely equal across parents swamps superior growth (when present) typically seen in foreign swamp no habitat with greater growth across all mangroves Thus, Rabinowitz found little evidence of the hypothesis that physiological conditions along a tidal gradient control mangrove zonation. The graph below shows survival of seedings of the four genera in the four different parent habitats. Key contribution: In response to her findings, Rabinowitz provides the “tidal sorting” hypothesis, which posits that “mangrove zonation may be controlled by tidal sorting of propagules according to size and by differential ability of propagules to establish in deep water.” She provides a discussion of the hypothesis as well as links it to several studies in the academic literature which support the notion. Further reading: Rabinowitz, 1978 - “Dispersal properties of mangrove propagules” Sousa et al, 2007 3.1.6 Putz &amp; Chan, 1986 “Tree growth dynamics and productivity in a mature mangrove forest in Malaysia” (Putz and Chan 1986) Key contribution: This study describes mangrove development and growth dynamics in a protected forest in Matang, Malaysia over the course of 60 years. The research represents one of the few studies done on mangroves over many decades, as disturbance regimes often prevent long-term succession as well as a lack of research interest. Key findings: Several key findings in long-term mangrove development were identified: R. apiculata slowly decreased in forest dominance relative to B. gymnorrhiza and B. parviflora. Bruguiera species are more shade-tolerant and may represent a more traditionally “climax” class of mangrove species. Gap openings were largely caused by termites and fungus killing trees, which would fall against neighboring trees, damage roots and bark and allow termites to transfer trees. Putz and Chan describe the disturbance dynamics as “domino-like,” but also note it is unlikley to be “normal” disturbance dynamics. Based on growth-rates and age-class distributions, Putz and Chan conclude that self-thinning did occur within the forest, particularly for R. apiculata. Total biomass was relatively high, with “stable” biomass estimated at 350-400 Mg/Ha. 3.1.7 Smith, 1992 “Forest structure” (In Robertson and Alongi, 2002) (Smith 1992) Overview: This chapter (from Robertson and Alongi, 2002) gives a broad overview of mangrove forest structure with a particular emphasis on zonation in species. Smith describes factors that influence species composition, the patterns of species assemblages across the intertidal zone, and physical forest structure attributes such as height or stem density. Key knowledge: Mangroves lack understory vegetation commonly found within terrestrial tropical forests Species zonation patterns differ between “Old World” and “New World” tropics six primary zonation hypotheses: land building &amp; succession geomorphology response to physico-chemical gradients tidal sorting hypothesis differential predation interspecific competition many mangroves have even-aged size-class structure stand height, density and biomass accumulation seem to correlate with climatic factors, particularly rainfall mangroves appear to have more pioneer-phase traits (e.g., r-strategy dispersal of propagules) relative to mature-phase traits **Status of zonation hypotheses as of 1992:* Further reading: Chapman 1976 - Extensive review of early literature surrounding mangrove zonation 3.1.8 Chen &amp; Twilley, 1998 “A gap dynamic model of mangrove forest development along gradients of soil salinity and nutrient resources” (Chen and Twilley 1998) Key contribution: This study employs a FORMAN model to examine forest development and succession in South Florida across nutrient gradients. The study is novel in that it employs an individual-tree based model to examine different effects of recruitment, nutrient availability, and response to disasters (hurricanes) for R. mangle, A. germinans and L. racemosa. Key findings: The study primarily examines i) species dominance (as measured by BA) in response to salinity and nutrient response surfaces, ii) regeneration following disturbance, and iii) long-term mangrove succession (500 yrs). Key findings from each of the three model explorations are detailed below: nutrient gradients - BA didn’t increase linearly with increasing soil fertility, indicating that light or competition influence forest development; patterns of forest development varied depending on time scales (35 vs. 100 vs. 300 years). At 100-year time frame, patterns in species partitioning along resource gradients was observed. disturbance - equal sapling recruitment scenarios for all three species overestimated total basal area, which is indicative that recruitment rates are not equal amongst species; succession - long-term succession was found to be sensitive to recruitment rates for each species. The degree of shade tolerance/intolerance of the different species was concluded to be significant in long-term succession dynamics. Research relevance: Can the same models be employed to look at shifts in forest structure due to sea-level rise? 3.1.9 Sherman et al, 2000 “Small-scale disturbance and regeneration dynamics in a neotropical mangrove forest” (Sherman, Fahey, and Battles 2000) Key contribution: Sherman et al describe chracteristics of gap creation and closure through time and gap regeneration dynamics in the Dominican Republic. The primary intermeidate disturbance at their site is lightning-induced gaps, with the forest regenerating from a large tidal wave several decades prior. Their evidence does not support the hypothesis that zonation in mangrove species is reinforced by gap regeneration, with R. mangle dominating gap regeneration in all three zone types. Key findings: The following key findings are provided by the study: Hypothesis that species zonation is reinforced by gap dynamics was not supported by evidence R. mangle dominated gap regeneration, not due to increased density of seedlings (found to be highly variable with patterns emerging depending on dominant species zone), but due to higher survivorship in standing water; seedling &amp; sapling growth found to be significantly greater in gaps than forest Gaps were characterized by a collapse of the peat-mat and thus regions of standing water found that seedling and sapling density generally followed mature tree (by basal area) compositions for both transects current spatial distribution of species zones is still unexplained for the site 3.1.10 Sousa et al, 2007 “Supply-side ecology in mangroves: Do propagule dispersal and seedling establishment explain forest structure?” (Sousa et al. 2007) Supply-side ecology: “hypothesis of community structure being influenced more heavily by supply of new individuals to a site rather than post-recruitment biotic interactions (Roughgarden by Lewin [1986])” Tidal sorting hypothesis: TSH has multiple components: Dispersal of mangrove propagules is controlled primarily by their shape and size Establishment of mangrove propagules is differentiated by size and depth of tidal waters Key contribution: Sousa et al provides one of the few empirical tests of the TSH. Their results by and large do not strictly support all components of the TSH: Direction (NOT SUPPORTED) - all propagules dispersed seawards, regardless of size Distance (SUPPORTED) - Laguncularia propagules travelled much further than Rhizophora or Avicennia trapping of seedlings behind logs or other barriers contributes to patchy establishment Establishment (SUPPORTED) - only Rhizophora established in the pen at the lowest tidal elevation, which is indicative that larger heavier propagules are better able to establish in deeper water (as TSH predicts) Key findings: Directional flow of rainfall runoff overwhelms tidal flows and causes all propagules to disperse in a seawards direction Rhizophora seedlings moved very short distances, indicating that their commonly-believed widespread dispersal via marine systems may be misrepresentative of average dispersal mechanisms, particularly within mature forests. The TSH does not sufficiently explain zonation at the Punta de Galeta. Sousa et al provide two alternative hypotheses for zonation TSH may function strictly during periods of tidal storm surge, when smaller propagules are carried much further inland Zonation may be a result of historical patterns of biogeography as the three species appeared in the region at different times In addition, the authors provide three key criticisms of Rabinowitz’s TSH: Her early studies of species survival and growth in stands of different parent organisms only lasted for a year, and thus physico-chemical factors may not have had time to influence survival given large nutrient reserves. Other studies, however, have since supported Rabinowitz’s findings and provide evidence against the physico-chemical hypothesis of zonation The patterns of zonation predicted by the TSH do not always occur in mangroves; their are examples of forests where the species patterning is different or even opposite from what is predicted. The pattern of disperal predicted by TSH does not hold in all cases; Sousa et al found that dispersal direction was actually opposite of what was predicted by TSH.

From a geomorphological standpoint, this is one of the most well-cited studies arguing that mangrove vegetation patterns respond primarily to the hydrological and sedimentary conditions that exist within a given site. 4.1.2 Carlton, 1974 “Land building and stabilization of mangroves” (Carlton 1974) Key contribution: This is a perhaps less seminal paper but provides a brief review of the literature surrounding the ability of mangroves to “build” and “stabilize” shorelines. Much of the reviewed work is from Florida. Key conclusions: Carlton concludes more or less that mangroves do not “build” land per se, but are influential upon the rate at which sediments accrete on shorelines. In sum, two viewpoints exist: mangroves “build” land by accretion of sediments (a la Davis 1940) (UNSUPPORTED) mangroves modify the rate at which sediments accrete, thus affecting the speed of geomorphic change rather than the direction (Egler 1952, Gill 1971) (SUPPORTED) Further reading: Egler 1952 Gill 1971 4.1.3 Thom, 1982 “Mangrove ecology: A geomorphological perspective” (Thom 1982) Key contribution: This study is best known for the five environmental settings that Thom lays out for clastic (terrigenous) sediment deposition. The five environmental settings are detailed below: River dominated - Deltaic or estuarine settings in which significant sediment is transported from alluvial flows to the coastal region. The landscape is marked by numerous distributaries and interdistributary basins that vary in hydrology, particularly in regards to tidal influence. Tide dominated - Estuarine type settings in which the dominant hydrology is the bidirectional flow of tides. Often see sandy shoals within the estuary that are shaped parallel to the flow of tides. Wave dominated - Environmental settings in which flat shorelines accumulate sand barriers or cheniers that create lagoons and create regions of low-energy coastlines in which mangroves may establish. Sediment is primarily autochthonous. River &amp; wave composite - Settings in which both deltaic plains with strong alluvial influence as well as strong wave influences create a complex of alluvial fans and lagoons blocked by wave-distributed sand barriers from longshore flows. E.g., Tabasco, Mexico. Drowned river valleys - Estuaries or embayments that are underlain by impervious rock and have been flooded during the most recent period of sea level rise. Key knowledge: Thom describes the geomorphology of mangrove from three standpoints: Geophysical - The dominant physical processes that affect a landscape, such as SLR or climate Geomorphic - The dynamic history of the land in response to the dominant geophysical factors. Can be broken into three scales: macro: clastic vs. carbonate sediments meso: dominant physical process (tide vs. riverine vs. wave) micro: microtopographic features such as drainage and elevation that produce environmental gradients Biological - Factors such as biogeography or competition that affect the landscape Additionally, Thom notes that his five suggested geomorphig settings are not comprehensive but are rather representative of dominant processes that may be relevant. Thom goes on to discuss variations and scale in time and space and their resultant effects on mangrove geomorphology. He concludes that zonation of mangrove species responds opportunistically to geomorphic setting, and areas with high geomorphic diversity will have high degrees of habitat variation. Topics to think about further: How do geomorphic settings related to soil texture and soil carbon? 4.1.4 Woodroffe, 1983 “Development of mangrove forests from a geological perspective” (Woodroffe 1983) Key contribution: This paper describes the development of an autochthnous, geomorphically inactive mangrove forests on Grand Cayman island. The study takes a geological perspective in that they examine soil depths and soil cores throughout the west peninsula, and reconstruct models of autochthonous development of the mangrove forest through time. Key findings: The study concludes that there were key tidal inlets which were eventually breached my rising sea levels and allowed for expanded colonization of the calcerous bedrock by mangroves. Soil depths &amp; cores indicate that there was a forest of landlocked mangroves at one point during low-levels (200 cm below present), but the authors are unsure of how tidal fluxes reached this area. 4.1.5 Thom, 1984 “Coastal landforms and geomorphic processes” (Thom 1984) Key contribution: This is an extension of (Thom 1982), in which Thom describes three carbonate settings. The conclusions are largely the same as (Thom 1982), and thus refer to section 4.1.3 for them. Key additions: The carbonate settings that Thom adds to his original five clastic settings are as follows: Carbonate platform - Accumulation of lime muds and peat on low-energy tropical coasts. Oftentimes the fringing mangroves are against large, open, shallow bodies of water. Coral reef or sand barriers may block wave and tidal energy to produce low-energy conditions Sand/shingle barrier - Mangroves may form on the cemented or non-cemented coral detritus, for example patchy mangroves colozining portions of the Great Barrier Reef. Sand mostly consists of carbonate particles and sea levels play an important part on depositional characteristics Carbonate embayments - Embayments in which soil “crusts” were submerged by SLR during Holocene. E.g., patchy mangroves on old reef complexes that are highly variable and reflect varability in the substrate complexity. Key knowledge: In addition, Thom discusses some of the prior models of succession and zonation in mangroves. In particular he identifies three trends of research, including one in which he situates himself: “Classical succesional view of mangroves” - The “Davis 1940” view of mangroves that emphasizes the role of biota rather than geophysical or geomorphological processes “Environmental gradient view” - The more “ecological niche” based view of vegetation patterning that results from environmental gradients; Watson 1928 was one of first studies to argue for this effect “Physiographic ecology” - regards physical and botanical landscapes as mosaics of landforms that result from differential effects of physical processes on different materials, and the promotion of different biological communities in response to them focused at landscape scale, geomorphic variety produces variety in biological assemblages Other reading: Snedaker, 1982 - Mangrove species zonation: Why? 4.1.6 Woodroffe, 1990 “The impact of sea-level rise on mangrove shorelines” (Woodroffe 1990) 4.1.7 Woodroffe, 1992 “Mangrove sediments and geomorphology” (Woodroffe 1992) Key contribution: This is a key synthesis of knowledge related to geomorphology and environmental settings in mangroves. 4.1.8 McKee, 2007 “Caribbean mangroves adjust to rising sea level through biotic controls on change in soil elevation” (McKee, Cahoon, and Feller 2007) References "],

The article reviews the current platforms and data types, and maps them to their relevant uses within geomorphology. Of particular note: Remote sensing particularly well placed to aid studies of geomorphology in: location and distribution of landforms land surface elevation land surface composition subsurface characterization The authors remark consistently on the added value of digital elevation models (both as products, as well as automatic classification by sensors) for geomorphology. Among most important techniques for postprocessing of LiDAR point clouds for geomorphologists is removing “surface clutter” to extract actual ground surface.

Key findings: the spectral and spatial composition of mangrove species and vegetation assemblages has complicated use of multispectral (broadband) imagery; hyperspectral (narrowband) imagery is promising but more difficult to access spectral signatures of different wetland veg are often similar, and are “muddied” by spectral reflectance from soil, hydrologic regime or atmospheric conditions spectral signatures affected most strongly by biochemical and biophysical properties of leaves, which vary greatly across species discrimination of wetland species from Landsat TM or SPOT imagery has generally been insufficient due to: lack of fine, ecological divisions between vegetation species broad nature of spectral wavebands lack of high spectral and spatial resolution to detect subcanopy vegetation types ANNs and fuzzy classification techniques have shown promise in better classifying mixed species pixels most important biochemical and biophysical properties characterizing wetland species are: chlorophyll - green pigment biomass concentration - biophysical prop leaf water content major issue of using vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) to estimate biomass is the saturation problem Mutanga and Skidmore (2004) propose one mechanism to resolve saturation problem building spectral libraries via hyperspectral sensors is critical for discriminating wetland species, but also needs investigation at different sites &amp; scales as reflectance within species may vary depending on environmental conditions Research ideas: Spectral imagery can be effective in monitoring plant water content, which may vary significantly across mangrove species due to differing water use efficiencies Further reading: 5.1.3 Heumann, 2011 “Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities” (Heumann 2011) Key contribution: One of several reviews of mangroves and remote sensing techniques that focuses primarily (i.e., solely) on vegetation mapping. Key findings: Spectral discrimination of different species not successful using multispectral (broadband) imagery (Ramsey and Jensen, 1996). Mixed pixels also an issue for discriminating species as well as estimating canopy structure Spectral saturation at high biomass values is a particular problem for mapping biomass and volumes Very high resolution imagery effective at reducing mixed pixels just due to smaller size OBIA has typically been applied to species discrimination rather than extent of mangrove mappings Quickbird and IKONOS sensors are most common for very high resolution imagery due to long-term archiving of data multispectral sensors but show improvement over Landsat TM or ETM+ due to reduced numbers of mixed pixels Use of spectral data only is often insufficient for discrimination of species Classification accuracies are greatly improved when other image properties are considered, such as texture Texture analaysis has been applied to species discrimination, but has not been investigated (as of 2011) for other forest characteristics C-band PolSAR has lowest ability to parse forest structure of SAR bands Mangrove biomass specific findings: Canopy height and biomass have been shown to be strongly correlated in mangroves (e.g., Fromard et al., 1998; Smith and Whelan, 2006) must studies of height and biomass have employed SAR data different polarizations (based on wavelength) interact differently with different components of the forest trunks and soils may produce single or double bounce interactions signal may scatter within canopy P-band POLSAR or HV polarization of L-band SAR perform best in mapping aboveground biomass Very-high resolution satellites: The IKONOS and Quickbird are most commonly used, due to archiving of data and plans for long-term consistency IKONOS &gt; GeoEye-1 (successor) (multispect @ 1.65 m and panchrom @ 0.41 m) Quickbird &gt; Worldview-2 (successor) (&lt;2m multi, &lt;0.5 m panchrom) note that Worldview-2 has 8 multispectral channels, including those in yellow and red edge ranges designed for veg studies Research ideas: Coupling of species mapping with species-specific allometry equations for better estimates of mangrove biomass Might make sense in Americas where just three species exist (easier!) 5.1.4 Kuenzer, 2011 “Remote sensing of mangrove ecosystems: A review” (Kuenzer et al. 2011) References "],

The article primarily discusses: Defining biocomplexity Examining the characteristics of biocomplexity Speculating on future of biocomplexity Biocomplexity - “properties emerging from the interplay of behavioral, biological, chemical, physical, and social interactions that affect, sustain, or are modified by living organisms, including humans” (as defined by (Michener et al. 2001)) Key notes: Biocomplexity exists in contrast to the Popperian type of reductionalist science (causality &amp; falsification), and recognizes that reduced causal mechanisms often are not robust within real-world situations “myriad confounding factors operating at different temporal and spatial scales” Two features of “biocomplexity” biocomplexity occurs as temporal, spatial and conceptual boundaries are broken-down and worked across emergent &amp; unexpected properties may (or likely will) arise in response to biocomplexity Characteristics of “biocomplexity”: relevant for a wide range of organisms microbial to megafauna [(including humans)] relevant for a wide range of environments reflected in nonlinear, chaotic, or unpredictable behaviors – which likely necessitates sophisticated and innovative quantitative procedures likely to span many hierarchical levels as well as across multiples scales in space and time Key research trajectories for ecology (as posed by Thompson 2001): “dynamics of coalescence in complex communities” - how do environmental constraints and species availability result in current complex ecological communities “ecological memory” - how do past events &amp; conditions influence current ecological structure conditions “emergent properties” - examining whether first principles of “hard” sciences can predict composition, structure &amp; function “ecological topology” - identifying “rules” that occur over different scales of time and space and examining how they interact to produce ecosystems Further reading: (Thompson et al. 2001) - Frontiers of ecology: As ecological research enters a new era of collaboration, integration, and technological sophistication, four frontiers seem paramount for understanding how biological and physical processes interact over multiple spatial and temporal scales to shape the earth’s biodiversity 6.1.2 Jones et al, 2006 “The new bioinformatics: Integrating ecological data from the gene to the biosphere” (Jones et al. 2006) Key contribution: This paper makes the case for “locating, accessing and integrating” data within ecology. They provide examples of the successes associated with doing so in alternative fields (genetics), and make a case for the need within ecology. They also outline metadata-drive versus vertically integrated databases (data warehouses), and the relative pros/cons of the two. Examples of metadata and data collections in ecology: Key notes: Some relevant points from the article: Focus on “experimental” design and testing of multiple hypotheses makes ecological data inherently heterogeneous. Ecoinformatics importance is housed in ability to “allow a broader perspective over time and space, and across many disciplines, than is possible from on or a few studies,” and in allowing data to be reused for questions that may emerge in the future. Current standard for storing of data is in heterogeneous spreadsheets Data warehouses (vertically-integrated) - databases that coalesce data from many investigators, but focused on one theme and searchable often through an online interface; often represents a “least-common denominator” approach in that they are less complex than original dataset examples: GenBank, VegBank or TreeBase Data collections (metadata-drive) - collection of datasets that are loosely structured together by well-crafted metadata advantages: data of disparate types can be housed within a single location focuses on project-level data and thus is familiar to researchers metadata often more detailed metadata often more precise and thus can be used in search functions metadata standards - “consistent and rigorous sets of definitions for metadata categories that are broadly adopted by a research community” Several examples exist within ecology: Ecological Metadata Language (EML) Biological Data Profile (BDP) Geographic Markup Language (GML) the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) is a metadata-drive repo that provides mappings from EML to BDP (but not from BDP to EML as of time of article publication). data islands - data derived from researchers working on disparate, autonomous topics that focus on specific, predetermined hypotheses often subject to entrenched domain-specific vocabularies and also assumptions ontologies - well-defined concepts or terms that have precise meanings within a specific domain or field, as well as how the terms interrelate Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge (SEEK) - one example of a system developing ontologies within ecology Further reading: Look into metadata languages (e.g., EML) Look into some of the earlier work on databases by Michener 6.1.3 Michener, 2006 “Meta-information concepts for ecological data management” (Michener 2006) Definitions: - metadata - “information about data”; higher level descriptions of data - meta-information - information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses Key contribution: Michener outlines some of the key criteria, challenges and opportunities for metadata within an ecological context. Notes on metadata: Benefits of metadata Longevity of the data is greatly increased Reuse of the data both by the original researcher and others is facilitated Well-documented data may be used to expand scale of ecological inquiry Metadata functionality Supports data discovery (most basic level) Facilitates the acquisition and use of data by humans (requires additional metadata) Enables automatic discovery, ingestion and analysis of data (requires more sophisticated metadata), which needs: research context (hypothesis, study site, experimental design, etc.) status of dataset physical structure of dataset info to facilitate use and comprehension Ecological Metadata Language (EML): EML is a standard for metadata that provides structure that supports automated functions of metadata listed above and is implemented in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Organized into modules, such as “dataset”, “access”, “physical”, “party coverage”, “project”, “methods”, “datatable”, “attribute”, and “physical” additional info at “ecoinformatics.org” 6.1.4 Bekker et al, 2007 “Long term datasets: From descriptive to prescriptive data using ecoinformatics” (Bekker et al. 2007) Key contribution: This is the lead article to a special issue in Journal of Vegetation Science that focuses on ecoinformatics driven approaches to understanding complexity within vegetation systems. The article is less informative in its own right as much as a good pointer to other key studies working with vegetation science and ecoinformatics. It appears to be one of the earliest applications of ecoinformatics to vegetation science. Further reading: Le Duc, 2007 - A database application for long-term ecological field experiments Peacock, 2007 - The RAINFOR database, for monitoring forest biomass and dynamics 6.1.5 Hale &amp; Hollister, 2009 “Beyond data management: How ecoinformatics can benefit environmental monitoring programs” (Hale and Hollister 2009) Key contribution: This is actually a relatively lackluster study that I added. They describe the relevance of ecoinformatics for environmental monitoring, but do not go much beyond some of the other pieces on ecoinformatics and its relevance for ecology. Some relevant points that stood out to me: Standardization of taxonomic classes may be facilitated by ecoinformatics and application of ontologies in ecoinformatics Establishing standards and protocols can help in synthesizing studies and results across time and space Note: Likely better to focus on other studies within the literature than this one as they don’t bring up many points beyond those expressed in more seminal works. 6.1.6 Feller et al, 2010 “Biocomplexity in mangrove ecosystems” (Feller et al. 2010) Key contribution: Aim to elucidate the factors playing in at different hierarchical levels in mangrove ecosystems (biocomplexity). They use emergent properties (which they define as “patterns or processes that occur at multiple hierarchical levels within ecosystems”) to examine underlying ecological processes within mangroves. Key findings: The article doesn’t differ much from other reviews of controls on mangrove processes, apart from the structure in which they examine: controls of emergent properties (namely specializations for variable salinity, flooding and nutrient availability) e.g., salinity tolerance, flooding tolerance, reproductive traits/regeneration, nutrient availability perhaps analogous to “processes” collective properties of forests (e.g., zonation, productivity, nutrient cycling, food webs) perhaps analogous to “functions” emergent/collective properties of ecosystems &amp; landscapes (e.g., habitat stability &amp; connectivity of ecosystems) perhaps analogous to “services” or “benefits” They discuss Individual Based Models (IBMs) as useful though limited tools for examining biocomplexity within mangroves, but note that there is relatively little work in this field to date. Relevance to research: Are IBMs relevant for research questions at hand? 6.1.7 Michener &amp; Jones, 2012 “Ecoinformatics: Supporting ecology as a data intensive science” (Michener and Jones 2012) Key contribution: This is a seminal study on the relevance of ecoinformatics written by two of the leading thinkers in the field. Key notes: Several key notes from the study are: The authors describe the ‘data life cycle’, with 8 steps that do not necessarily occur in sequential order and depend upon the analysis research question at hand. The steps are: plan - derive a data management plan that is often a living document as needs and uses for data will change over time collect - highly variable mechanisms under which this occur given the vast amount of data types and collecting methods that exist; standardization in collection procedures is key for synthesizing data at later times assure - measures taken to ensure data quality both before and after collection of the data; may consist of standardization of codes, units or metadata (e.g., using EML) describe - sufficiently describing the data via metadata (who, what, when, where, why) preserve - depositing of data in a repository such that they may be verified, maintained and accessible through time discover - identifying appropriate data for research question of interest; double-edged sword in that you can get millions of hits or alternatively have tons of distinct data sources that exist only on disparate, local machines Use of DataONE - sophisticated search tools that drill down into data to identify datasets of actual interest; this is where ontologies come into play integrate - understanding methodological diffs, transforming to common representations and converting and recoding data to comparable semantics analyze - reproducibility in analysis, with a particular focus on scientific workflows DataONE: DataONE is a research platform that seeks to support the entire data life cycle, as well as integrate many different forms of data. There are three principle components: 1. Member Nodes - contribute data, computing resources and services (e.g., data repositories, universities, computing centers) 2. Coordinating Nodes - support network-wide services such as indexing, replication, and interactability of Member Nodes 3. Investigator Toolkit - tools for researchers to employ in all steps of the data life cycle The data life cycle: References "],

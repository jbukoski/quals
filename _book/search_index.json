Key findings: the spectral and spatial composition of mangrove species and vegetation assemblages has complicated use of multispectral (broadband) imagery; hyperspectral (narrowband) imagery is promising but more difficult to access spectral signatures of different wetland veg are often similar, and are “muddied” by spectral reflectance from soil, hydrologic regime or atmospheric conditions spectral signatures affected most strongly by biochemical and biophysical properties of leaves, which vary greatly across species discrimination of wetland species from Landsat TM or SPOT imagery has generally been insufficient due to: lack of fine, ecological divisions between vegetation species broad nature of spectral wavebands lack of high spectral and spatial resolution to detect subcanopy vegetation types ANNs and fuzzy classification techniques have shown promise in better classifying mixed species pixels most important biochemical and biophysical properties characterizing wetland species are: chlorophyll - green pigment biomass concentration - biophysical prop leaf water content major issue of using vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) to estimate biomass is the saturation problem Mutanga and Skidmore (2004) propose one mechanism to resolve saturation problem building spectral libraries via hyperspectral sensors is critical for discriminating wetland species, but also needs investigation at different sites &amp; scales as reflectance within species may vary depending on environmental conditions Research ideas: Spectral imagery can be effective in monitoring plant water content, which may vary significantly across mangrove species due to differing water use efficiencies Further reading: 6.1.2 Heumann, 2011 “Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities” (Heumann 2011) Key contribution: One of several reviews of mangroves and remote sensing techniques that focuses primarily (i.e., solely) on vegetation mapping. Key findings: Spectral discrimination of different species not successful using multispectral (broadband) imagery (Ramsey and Jensen, 1996). Mixed pixels also an issue for discriminating species as well as estimating canopy structure Spectral saturation at high biomass values is a particular problem for mapping biomass and volumes Very high resolution imagery effective at reducing mixed pixels just due to smaller size OBIA has typically been applied to species discrimination rather than extent of mangrove mappings Quickbird and IKONOS sensors are most common for very high resolution imagery due to long-term archiving of data multispectral sensors but show improvement over Landsat TM or ETM+ due to reduced numbers of mixed pixels Use of spectral data only is often insufficient for discrimination of species Classification accuracies are greatly improved when other image properties are considered, such as texture Texture analaysis has been applied to species discrimination, but has not been investigated (as of 2011) for other forest characteristics C-band PolSAR has lowest ability to parse forest structure of SAR bands Mangrove biomass specific findings: Canopy height and biomass have been shown to be strongly correlated in mangroves (e.g., Fromard et al., 1998; Smith and Whelan, 2006) must studies of height and biomass have employed SAR data different polarizations (based on wavelength) interact differently with different components of the forest trunks and soils may produce single or double bounce interactions signal may scatter within canopy P-band POLSAR or HV polarization of L-band SAR perform best in mapping aboveground biomass Very-high resolution satellites: The IKONOS and Quickbird are most commonly used, due to archiving of data and plans for long-term consistency IKONOS &gt; GeoEye-1 (successor) (multispect @ 1.65 m and panchrom @ 0.41 m) Quickbird &gt; Worldview-2 (successor) (&lt;2m multi, &lt;0.5 m panchrom) note that Worldview-2 has 8 multispectral channels, including those in yellow and red edge ranges designed for veg studies Research ideas: Coupling of species mapping with species-specific allometry equations for better estimates of mangrove biomass Might make sense in Americas where just three species exist (easier!) 6.1.3 Kuenzer, 2011 “Remote sensing of mangrove ecosystems: A review” (Kuenzer et al. 2011) Key contribution: This is a very extensive review of remote sensing and mangroves. Notes: Optical imagery: The spectral signature of mangrove leaves are largely a function of age, vitality, phenological props and physiological props. Greater discrimination between species (at least in Vietnam) may be seen in the NIR, but little differentiation seen in VIS: Radar imagery: SAR imagery provides intensity values of the “backscatter coefficient”. Given different polarizations and wavelengths of SAR scanning, different interactions with mangrove landscape occur. The different SAR bands are as follows: X-band - 3 cm wavelength, effective for direct backscatter from canopy C-band - 6 cm, plant/soil multiple and volume scattering L-band - 24 cm, direct backscatter from soil &amp; water Sensors: See Table 2 in the study for an extensive list of sensors used within remote sensing of mangrove studies Aerial imagery is limited in that it cannot be scaled beyond immediate site/locality, but has value in that it can provide high-resolution data particularly for hard to access sites without field data. High spatial resolution data (IKONOS &amp; Quickbird) Ultimate goal is to map mangroves at the species level A comparison of IKONOS and QuickBird found IKONOS (4 m) to be more effective at discriminating in species because of the higher spectral resolution. QuickBird has higher spatial resolution (1 m) but was less useful in this particular investigation (Greg’s paper). Hyperspectral imagery identifying relevant bands is a time intensive process and many bands are highly correlated EnMAP sensor satellite hyperspectral data that will provide more access to hyperspectral datasets globally is this online? I’m not sure yet. Several tables are given in the paper that describe the various data sensors and platforms and their relative benefits and limitations for remote sensing of mangroves. Needs within RS of mangroves space: The authors call for several needs within the remote sensing of mangrove space: Need for homogenized classification schemes - ontologies, e.g., what is a sparse versus dense mangrove Need for standardized data-processing models - standardiziing preprocessing, processing and post processing such that enhanced comparability of studies is enabled Need for homogenized transparent accuracy assessment - self explanatory Need for further investigations of synergistic data use - coupling of new, novel and disparate RS datasets to investigate novel research questions Need for ecosystem service assessments Need for interdisciplinary and well-networked research teams 6.1.4 Giri, 2016 “Observation and monitoring of mangrove forests using remote sensing: Opportunities and challenges” (Giri 2016) Key contribution: This is an introductory piece to a special issue on monitoring mangroves using RS. There are potentially interesting pieces in the special issue but most are focused on vegetation dynamics rather than geomorphology. Giri is one of the key researchers working on mapping of mangrove forests using RS data, and offers some succint advice on steps for classifying mangrove forests: identify clear and concise objective develop classification system and legend satellite and secondary data acquisition data pre-processing training data collection image classification results validation dissemination of results application of classification results *Random notes:* Important to be clear on consideration of purely true mangroves, or true mangroves with mangrove associates.

["vegetation.html", "6.2 Vegetation", " 6.2 Vegetation 6.2.1 Ramsey, 1996 “Remote sensing of mangrove wetlands: Relating canopy spectra to site-specific data” (Ramsey and Jensen 1996) Key significance: This is one of the earliest comprehensive attempts to relate multispectral wavelength data to mangrove forest structure characteristics. In particular, the study seeks out to answer two primary questions: What are the spectral and structural changes within and between mangrove species and community types? What are the relationships between the canopy spectral variability at the blue, green, red and NIR wavelength regions and canopy species composition and structural variability? Their results largely showed that remote sensing of species composition is quite difficult (no relationships between species composition and spectral indices exist), but LAI and a few other parameters (canopy height) were found to be significantly correlated with some spectral bands/vegetation indices. Research design: Field structure and species composition data was collected and coupled with remotely sensed spectral data. Regression and other statistical techniques were used to relate the data to the various spectral measures and their arithmetic transforms. Spectral measurements were taken in the lab, from a helicopter platform, and also from SPOT satellite. Key notes &amp; results: The following results and key conclusion of the study should be noted: LAI was calculated as a transform of canopy closure, which was collected with a hemispherical mirror Significant correlations of any of the bands with percent species composition was not significant The strongest correlations between spectral signatures and forest structure data was with LAI LAI was not significantly correlated with species composition, but was significantly correlated with forest height, which indicates that canopy depth expands with increasing canopy height. 6.2.2 Green, 1998 “Remote sensing techniques for mangrove mapping” (Green et al. 1998) Key significance: The study reviews common methods of remote sensing for mangrove mapping, with a particular emphasis on the fact that accuracy assessments are rarely performed following classification of RS mangrove imagery. The authors then couple the most commonly used techniques with accuracy assessments using field-based data to examine the relative strengths &amp; weaknesses of the different techniques. Research design: The study employs three spectral image datasets (Landsat 6 TM, SPOT, and Airborne multispectral data at 1 m resolution) for generating of RS imagery of mangroves in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The review of classificatin of spectral imagery for mangroves identifies 5 different methodologies: Visual interpretation - the user classifies areas, though often with a radiometric enhancement applied to the imagery Vegetation index - different vegetation indices can be employed such as ratio indices (NDVI) or orthogonal indices (tasseled cap transformations); this study uses NDVI with a ISODATA clustering algorithm producing 50 classes that are identified and edited to match mangroves Unsupervised classification - may or may not involve image enhancement; this study used ISODATA clustering algo on unenhanced imagery Supervised classification - most common method of mangrove classification and may or may not include image enhancement (e.g., enhancing edges between stands or species types); this study uses 3 x 3 edge enhancement filter applied to imagery, useful in mangroves given linear nature PCA and band ratios - ratios of different bands can be effective in distinguishing different landscape features; this study uses the ratios of various Landsat and SPOT bands, runs PCA, and then generates an image based on the most significant PCAs (which they then classify) Accuracy assessment was performed using three metrics (following Congalton, 1991): Overall accuracy - overall agreement as sum of correctly labelled sites divided by total number of sites User accuracy - probability that a classified pixel actually represents that category on the ground Producer accuracy - how often real features on ground are shown correctly on the map; NOT used in this study] Tau coefficient - indicates the percent of pixels classified correctly than would be expected by chance alone Key results: The authors largely justify the work based on: A lack of widespread accuracy assessments within the literature A discussion of the limitations of climate on spectral RS imagery classification (although their methods only examine spectral datasets; they give SAR a head nod in the review section) Discrimination of mangrove vs. non-mangrove vegetation: SPOT XS imagery was not effective at producing accurate classifications of mangrove extent. CASI (airborne) data was highly effective at identifying mangrove vegetation (with all five methods producing overall accuracies greater than 50%), whereas methods performed on Landsat data improved markedly with increased computational sophistication (i.e., method 5). Accurate classification of Landsat data required the calculation of PCs and band ratios, rather than processing of just raw band data. In general, visual identification and ratio index based classifications are not effective at classifying mangroves. Additionally, merging of Landsat TM and SPOT XP (i.e., down-sampling Landsat data) was found to be effective at improving mapping classifications (using both a principle components merge, as well as an intensity-hue-saturation merge). Discrimination of mangrove habitats: The results show that the airborne spectral data (CASI) was most effective at accurately classifying 9 different mangrove classes. Reasonable classification accuracies could be achieved with the Landsat data for a reworking of just three mangrove classes (tall Rhizophora, other mangrove, and non-mangrove), but were highly inaccurate for a 9-class map. Note: There is a nice table of other works on mangrove mapping and remote sensing in the introduction. It may be good to review this table again at a later date. 6.2.3 Proisy, 2000 “Interpretation of polarimetric radar signatures of mangrove forests” (Proisy et al. 2000) Key contribution: This study reviews the interaction of backscattering signals of different polarizations of SAR data with components of a mangrove forest. Research design: The study took field-based data on forest structure and species composition, as well as collected data from the P-, L-, and C-Bands of AIRSAR data (NASA JPL; airborne SAR). They calculated a number of backscattering coefficients for each of the polarizations (HH, VV and HV), as well as the copolarization ratio (VV/HH) as well as two cross-polarization ratios (HH/HV and VV/HV). The different bands were acquired at a mean incidence angle of 35 degrees at: P-band: 0.44 GHz L-band: 1.25 GHz C-band: 5.3 GHz Key findings: Within the L-band, surface scattering or double-bounce effects dominate up until approximately 150-200 Mg/ha, whereas volume scattering (i.e., within the canopy) dominates for biomass values greater than 150-200 Mg/ha. The dominant contributer to the backscattering coefficient depends on the type of forest being monitored. For example: Mature or declining stands with biomass greater than 300 Mg/ha have volume scatter at all frequencies. Mature or declining stands with biomass between 100 - 300 Mg/ha have dominant volume scattering at C-band, volume and double-bounce scattering at L-band, and double-bounce scattering at P-band Pioneer stages with less than 100 Mg/ha biomass have volume scattering present in all three polarizations of C-band, double-bounce or surface scattering at L-band, and all three present (though interaction term is strongest) at the L-band for all three polarizations. Overall, P-band provides most pronounced polarimetric signatures, and is the most useful for distinguishing between different scattering mechanisms and thus different forest stages. A nice summary figure of the interactions between forest structure and radar returns is below: Notes: Prior studies have found that there is a strong positive relation between SAR backscattering coefficients and total biomass, particularly for P-HV and L-HV. The main contributions to the total backscattering coefficient response are: the soil scattering component the volume scattering component the double-bounce scattering component 6.2.4 Proisy, 2002 “On the influence of canopy structure on radar backscattering in mangrove forests” (Proisy et al. 2002) Key significance: One of a series of studies by Proisy et al, this particular study examines two mangrove forest stands of near identical aboveground biomass, but markedly different forest structure. They examine the polarimetric SAR data that they collect from the two plots, and examine them in relation to the two different forest structures. The forest structures both contain ~75 Mg biomass/ha, but are structured as: A pioneer stand of L. racemosa that is extremely dense (~12,000 trees/ha) and has much higher basal area (21.0 m2/ha) A declining stand with two canopy strata: A. germinans that are dying off and form an open, tall canopy (250 trees/ha, 4.2 m2/ha &amp; 19 m height) R. mangle that are replacing the A. germinans (31 trees/ha, 0.2 m2/ha &amp; 8 m height) Research design: The same research methods as (Proisy et al. 2000) (see Section 6.2.3) were employed, but this particular study focused on an in-depth comparison of two plots with similar aboveground biomass values, but markedly different forest structure characteristics. Key results: Overall, the backscattering from the open stand was higher than that of the closed (pioneer) stand. With the help of a polarimetric scattering model, they found that the three primary contributers to backscattering (volume vs. interaction vs. surface scattering) differed between the two stands for select polarizations. Additionally, they note two key concluding remarks: Use of correlation backscatter to biomass relationships should be restricted to homogeneous closed canopies. Distinguishing between stands of different developmental status should be possible via differences in backscaterring coefficients of the different SAR bands and polarizations A key figure that shows some of these differences is shown below: 6.2.5 Mutanga, 2004 “Narrow band vegetation indices solve the saturation problem in biomass estimation” (Mutanga and Skidmore 2004) Key significance: This study addresses the issue of vegetation index saturation at high biomass levels, and examines the effectiveness of hyperspectral data for resolving the issue. The study is largely motivated given that the “major limitation of using vegetation indices is asymptotic approach of a saturation level after a certain biomass density or LAI” Red edge - The rise of reflectance at the boundary between chlorophyll absorption in red wavelengths and leaf scattering in NIR wavelengths (680-750 nm). Red edge position can be defined as the point of maximum slope on the red infrared curve, and can be calculated by identifying the maximum of the first derivative Research design: The study primarily focuses on two approaches to resolving the saturation issue with biomass and vegetation indices: Use of narrow band vegetation indices, which are simply NDVI, Simple Ratio (SR) and Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI), but for 637 bands of hyperspectral data (350-2500 nm) Use of the red edge position A grass was grown in a greenhouse with two different nitrogen treatments (and one control group), and hyperspectral signatures were repeatedly taken. The various indices are computed for narrow band vegetation indices as well as indices using the red edge position. Key results: NDVI - The results clearly indicate an improvement in a relationship between biomass and an NDVI index derived from red edge spectral bands rather than standard (NIR and red) bands. SR - The results from the SR tests are similar to that of NDVI; reconstruction of SR using all possible hyperspectral band combinations indicates that bands from the red edge portion are most sensitive to changes in biomass TVI - Although distribution of the R2 values for reconstruction of this index differed visually from that of NDVI and SR (which were quite similar), the most efficient TVI was found to be constructed from bands in the red edge portion of the spectrum. The green portion of the spectrum also did well (e.g., second “best”) in reconstructing the vegetation indices. Red edge position - The red edge position was found to have a high correlation coefficient with biomass, indicating there is a significant correlation Of the three vegetation indices, SR was found to have the strongest correlation with biomass. Thus, narrow band derivations of SR from the red edge portion of the wavelength spectrum may be most efficient in estimating biomass from spectral data. 6.2.6 Wang, 2004a “Comparison of IKONOS and QuickBird images for mapping mangrove species on the Caribbean coast of Panama” (Le Wang et al. 2004) Key contribution: This study employs high resolution IKONOS (Space Imaging) and QuickBird (DigitalGlobe) imagery for improved mapping of mangrove species at Punta Galeta, Panama. In particular the study seeks to compare the imagery sources across three primary criteria: Spectral quality using subjective visual inspection and overall spectral statistics Classification effectiveness using multispectral bands with and without panchromatic bands Classification effectiveness following inclusion of textural information Research design: IKONOS (4 m multi, 1 m pan) and QuickBird (2.8 m multispec, 0.7 m panchrom) imagery were bought for the region and geometrically corrected. Training and validation plots for the major land cover classes (red, white, and black mangroves, roads, lagoons, and rainforest) were established and data were collected. MLC was used for classification of imagery using four multispectral bands, as well as a resampled panchromatic band at the resolution of the multispectral band resolution. Additionally, spectral information using the high resolution data of the imagery were computed and included within the classification algorithms. Two “order” textural layers were derived: A first order layer that was a simple measure of local variance within different sized rectangular neighborhoods that were coupled with the multispectral bands. A second order layer that uses a gray-level co-occurrence matrix to derive three features: contrast, correlation and entropy (see Clausi, 2002) Finally, an object-based approach was employed using the second order texture data. The image was segmented into objects, and then classification was applied to the resultant objects. Key results: The results generally show that the high resolution multispectral datasets were effective in accurate classifications of mangrove species. In particular: Standard deviation and entropy of the multispectral data for IKONOS was consistently higher than that of QuickBird, indicating that IKONOS captures richer spectral information than QuickBird Classification using purely multispectral data was slightly better for IKONOS than QuickBird Addition of the panchromatic band did not significantly improve accuracies Inclusion of a first order texture band improved accuracies for the IKONOS image; HOWEVER, accuracies decreased for QuickBird imagery, with the exception of the largest window size Second order texture data did not produce accurate classifications by themselves Under the object-based approach (using textural information in panchromatic and multispectral bands), almost equivalent classification accuracies were achieved It is important to note that the results do not support the expectation that the slightly higher spatial resolution of QuickBird imagery would result in “better” textural information for classification accuracies. Further reading: Textural analyses: Clausi, 2002 - An analysis of co-occurrence texture statistics as a function of grey level quantization Haralick et al, 1973 - Textural features for image classification 6.2.7 Wang, 2004b “Integration of object-based and pixel-based classification for mapping mangroves with IKONOS imagery” (L Wang, Sousa, and Gong 2004) Key significance: This is a sister study to the study reviewed in Section @(wang2004a). This study sought to examine three different classification methods: MLC at the pixel level Nearest neighbor classification at the pixel level A hybrid classification that combines pixel and object based methods (MLCNN) The consider the conundrum that with increasing spatial resolution, the number of detectable sub-class elements increases as well and thus classification at the pixel level may deteriorate. Thus, they examine object-based classification as a means of getting around this particular issue. Research design: For the site and imagery description see Section @(wang2004a). The different classification approaches used in this study are described here: MLC at pixel level - Object-based classification - Used eCognition 3.0 software (region merging technique that uses a homogeneity criteria to detemine whether pixels and regions should be merged). The merging “breaks off” at a predetermined parameter (small param = small regions, large param = large regions), and there are in principle infinite choices of break-off parameters* The authors develop a joint procedure in which MLC at pixel level is first used, in which spectrally inseparable classes are identified, and all spectrally separable classes are masked out. An object-based classification procedure is then performed on the spectrally inseparable classes. * To deal with the issue of infinate scale parameters, Wang et al develop a method to identify an optimal value. They use the training set data from the MLC image, reclassify all other pixels as 0s, and then use the image segmentation approach for several scale parameters. They then derive the pairwise Bhattacharya Distance values for the seven land cover classes at each scale, and select the scale at which BD reaches a maximum. Key results: In general, the accuracy of the classifications were relatively high for all three methods; however, the mixed pixel and object-based method performed the best. The key results are: The pixel based approach generally did well in correctly classifying the land cover classes (88.9% overall accuracy), with the exception of the red mangroves (71.3% accuracy), black mangroves (81.8%) and rainforest (81%) The object-based approach improved classification of the rainforest (100%0), red mangroves (77.5%) and black mangroves (89.8%), but greatly misclassified white mangroves (21.9%) due to their existence along edges with red and black and thus being pulled into “objects”; overall accuracy was relatively lower relative to the pixel based approach as a result (80.4%) The mixed pixel and object-based method performed the best because white mangrove, road, gap and lagoon all were highly separable using MLC, but distinguishing between red mangrove, black mangrove and rainforest benefitted from the object-based method (due to high confusion between these classes) The mixed method approach achieved overall classification accuracies of 91.4%. Key conclusions: The following conclusions are of particular note: The pixel-based method retains the spectral information at a fine spatial scale, but does not excel at distinguishing between spectrally similar classes (rainforest, red &amp; black mangrove) The object-based method averages spectral information, but in doing so is able to improve discrimination between spectrally similar regions (the difficult classes mentioned above) However, you run the risk of averaging unrelated pixels (likely unavoidable) 6.2.8 Vaiphasa, 2005 “Tropical mangrove species discrimination using hyperspectral data: A laboratory study” (C. Vaiphasa et al. 2005) Key contribution: At the time this study was written, hyperspectral studies of mangrove species classifications were relatively limited, and fairly inconclusive. This study soeeks to examine whether mangrove canopy leaves have sufficient spectral information to discriminate mangroves at the species level. Sixteen mangrove species were examined. Research design: Canopy leaves from 16 species were collected in Chumphon and hyperspectral signatures at 2151 spectral bands from 400 - 2500 nm were collected in laboratory conditions. One way ANOVA was used to examine for differences of individual species from one another across all spectral bands, and spectral separability of the species using a Jeffries-Matusita distance analysis metric. Given the issue of a massive feature space (2151 bands), four “optimal” bands for assessing spectral separability were identified using a wrapper feature selection approach. Key results: The results generally show that discrimination between the sixteen species is generally achievable. Some particular key results include: 1941 of the 2151 bands were found to be spectrally dissimilar across all species (ANOVA analysis) at th p &lt; 0.05 level. Of these 1941, 477 bands were significant at the &lt; 0.01 level. The exceptions were primarily at the UV region (350-400 nm) and the shortwave infrared region (1800-2500 nm), where lighting conditions may have played an influential role. The optimal band combination for classification was found to be: 720 nm, 1277 nm, 1415 nm and 1644 nm These results indicate that other properties beyond pigment (which would correspond to the 720 nm band) may play important roles in discrimination, and may be a result of other ecophysiological factors (water content, salinity, sugar, protein, oil, lignin, cellulose, leaf structure, etc.) Pair-wise separability of mangrove species was possible for many of the species using these four bands and the J-M distance metric, but reduced separability was seen for species of the Rhizophoraceae family. There was high confusion both amongst species within Rhizophoraceae, as well as with S. ovata, X. granatum and Pluchea indica.

Vaiphasa, Skidmore, and Boer 2006) Key contribution: This is one of the first studies to employ environmental data (pH) to refine classification maps of mangrove species. The study finds that classification accuracies are increased significantly, from 76.04% to 88.21%. Research design: The study coupled an existing mangrove species map produced from classification of ASTER imagery with a map of pH throught Pak Panang mangroves to examine the effectiveness of a post-classifier. In particular, they collected 200 pH measurements distributed throughout the forest, 150 of which were used for interpolation of a salinity profile, and 50 of which were used for validation. They additionall collected species composition and forest structure data at &gt;500 plots of 15 x 15 m2 in the forest, and used these for accuracy assessment of the maps. The post-classifier was based on a Bayesian approach that employed probabilities of species given a pH level, and pH level given a species. Key results: Accuracy of the mangrove species map was improved significantly with the addition of the pH data. In particular: Overall accuracy was improved from 76.04 - 88.21% following inclusion of pH data Speckling within the original mangrove species map was greatly reduced following inclusion of the pH layer Confusion between R. mucronata and S. caseolaris persisted despite the inclusion of the pH data In reference to the results from Vaiphasa (2005), they found that the addition of the pH data was able to improve the separability of species within the Rhizophoraceae family (which exhibited high confusion following classification of hyperspectral data) The authors conclude that the method presented (classification followed by updating with ecological gradient data) may be an efficient means for producing detailed mangrove species maps in areas that are not too large (e.g., &lt; 100 km2). 6.2.10 Wang, 2009 “Distinguishing mangrove species with laboratory measurements of hyperspectral leaf reflectance” (LE Wang and Sousa 2009) Key contribution: Le and Wayne largely repeat the Vaiphasa, 2005 study (see Section 6.2.8) but for the three mangrove species common to central America. In addition, they examine the ability of hyperspectral data to estimate stress conditions in mangrove trees. Research design: They collected leaves from all three species in both stressed and unstressed conditions, and also collected leaves from the top and bottom portions of the canopy. They then subjected each of the leaves to hyperspectral measurements in a laboratory setting before analyzing the data. To reduce the feature space prior to spectral discrimination, they first used the ANOVA across all spectral bands to remove any bands that were non significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level (a la Vaiphasa, 2005). They then use Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) to examine for differences amongst the species. In addition, they use several indices of spectral bands identified by prior work as indices of leaf stress. Chlorophyl a and b contents drop dramatically in stressed leaves, greatly changing the reflectance properties of leaves. Studies have found that ratios are best in identifying stress characteristics, and they use these within ANOVA to compare means of ratios between stressed and unstressed leaves. Key results: The results generally find that hyperspectral data is effective in species discrimination and also identification of stressed mangrove trees. Some particularly key results are as follows: 116 of the 215 bands were significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level for distinguishing between species and were clustered in the 350-510 nm, 610-690 nm, 760-810 nm, 1370-1550 nm, and 1850-2500 nm ranges of the spectrum Red, white and black mangroves were capable of being discriminated using the hyperspectral data Use of the ratios for identifying stress in mangrove trees was effective, with different ratios performing better for different species (3/4 for red, 1/4 for white, and 4/4 for black) The specific band widths identified as significant in this study different from those of Vaiphasa, 2005 Key conclusions: Some key, broader-level conclusion from the study are as follows: Conventional challenges to analysing hyperspectral data are the large number of highly correlated bands available coupled with relatively smaller numbers of training and test samples. Wang and Sousa conclude that use of hyperspectral data is effective in overcoming the shortcomings of the multispectral datasets that they use in their 2004 sister studies. 6.2.11 Kamal, 2011 “Hyperspectral data for mangrove species mapping: A comparison of pixel-based and object-based approach” (Kamal and Phinn 2011) Key contribution: This study employs high resolution, hyperspectral data to map mangroves and wetland land classes at a landscape scale in Australia using three different methods. There are relevant points they make but the study feels somewhat lacking in general. Research design: CASI-2 hyperspectral data were used as the imagery (30 bands and 4 m spatial resolution) in this study. An existing digital map of mangrove species produced via photographic interpretation of aerial imagery, site data, and traverses was used for endmembers selection and accuracy assessments of the classifications. They use three different classification procedures to produce different maps of the landscape: Spectral angle mapper – uses a spectral library representative of different end members (i.e., the 9 targeted wetland classes) and assigns pixel to each based on a similarity measure Linear spectral unmixing – assumes each spectral signature is a linear combination of area weighted sum of reflectance of endmembers; total areas or pixels may then be assigned based on probabilistic basis Object-based mapping – used OBIA to segment the image before applying classification algorithms on the spectral signatures Key results: Of the three methods examined, OBIA performed the best (overall classification accuracy of 76%). Linear spectral unmixing produced the lowest overall classification accuracy. Conclusion: The classification accuracy is relatively lower than those found in other studies, and thus the results feel perhaps a bit short-sighted. Other metrics that could have been interesting to explore would have been texture given the high resolution nature of the dataset. Additionally, they do not dig into the hyperspectral bandwidths that are relevant, and thus there is valuable information that is missing from the study. Additionally, it is not entirely clear to me whether they used the coarse level reference map for their accuracy assessment, or whether field data was collected. If the reference map is of low-quality, their results are rather meaningless. 6.2.12 Dronova, 2012 “Landscape analysis of wetland plant functional types: The effects of image segmentation scale, vegetation classes and classification methods” (Dronova et al. 2012) Key contribution: This study examines the classification accuracy of plant functional types (PFTs) under different image segmentation scales and classification algorithms for Poyang Lake in China. The key results generally show that use of a coarser image scale (on average 5-8 Landsat pixels) significantly improved image classification of the different PFTs. Classification between the different algorithms were less significant. Research design: Field data for training and test validation were collected, and Landsat 5 TM data (bands 1-5 &amp; 7) were used for all image classification procedures. Image segmentation was performed at 9 different scales from (2 - 10), and six different classification algorithms were used: Bayesian Logistic Neural network Decision trees K-Nearest neighbors Support vector machines The image classification procedure was performed under two scenarios, the first being for generalized PFTs (3 classes), and the second being for specific PFTs (6 classes). Water, sand and other development were excluded prior to classification. Cluster analysis was performed on morphological and physiological data of the 51 species within the landscape to identify the different classes. Additionally, texture metrics within objects were computed and included in the classification procedure to examine their utility. Key results: The results found that OBIA generally improved the results of the classification for both the 3-class and 6-class sets Some specific results include: A scale of 8 was found to produce the highest classification accuracies for both classification sets (i.e., objects of 5-8 Landsat pixels) However, at the specific PFT level, the optimal scale parameter was found to be variable Texture metrics were not found to significantly improve classification accuracies, indicating that discrimination between the various classes was primarily spectrally based Overall classification accuracy was relatively similar for the different classification algorithms The authors conclude that smoothing of spectral signatures within objects lends to greater discrimination between PFTs, aiding in overall classification. Texture metrics may have proven to be insignificant in improving classification accuracies due to the relatively coarse nature of the Landsat data. Most other studies that have found texture to be significant have used high resolution imagery. Human interference and ecological conditions that produced mixed pixels resulted in reduced classification accuracy, and the authors conclude that mixed approaches (i.e., object-based followed by pixel-based, a la (L Wang, Sousa, and Gong 2004)) may be an interesting means of resolving this issue. However, propagation of uncertainty has been under-explored and will be important in such scenarios. Placeholder "],

Key notes: Of key importance for mapping of flooded vs. non-flooded forests is the fact that SAR imagery has a much more intense return off of water versus dry soil or trunks. Thus, the “double-bounce” effect off of a water surface is much stronger than that from soil &amp; then tree. An excellent schematic of this effect is shown below: Accuracy of flood detection Some have found an issue in that canopy that is too dense may attenuate the signal at too great of a degree, and thus the difference between the more intense return from flooded forests may not be apparent (L-band). Additionally, presence of herbaceous vegetation (e.g., salt marshes) adjacent to flooded forests may erroneously appear as “flooded” forest using L-band. The bright return may be a result of the fleshy, vertically-oriented leaf stalks. These areas are still flooded, however, and thus it may still be effective for mapping of flooding extent, perhaps just not between flooded forest vs. flooded non-forest. Magnitude of enhancement Enhancement from flooded forest may range from approximately 2 - 10 dB. Effect of radar parameters Of primary importance are three considerations: Incidence angle - angles at which imagery is collected vary greatly, and may be an important parameter for efficacy of detecting flooding The most effective angle may depend on the ecosystem type. Flooded forests verses swamps may exhibit different dominant backscattering mechanisms. Polarization - the polarization of the radar may effect the efficacy of the return in identifying inundated landscapes Majority of studies have used HH polarization (Seasat, SIR-A, SIR-B) Qualitative assessments are consistent in findings that like-polarized scenes (HH or VV) are more effective at identifying flooded forests via L-band Frequency - use of P-, L-, or X-band may have different dominant backscattering mechanisms, and thus may influence detection of inundation. L-band commonly used due to ability to penetrate dense canopies, however may have have some limitations P-band may be promising for mapping of inundated forests in forests that are very tall or with very dense canopies Applications in flooded forest research Critical to examine the temporal and spatial variability of water cover. An important component is availability of ground data on extent and time of flooding at the time of imaging, particularly tricky for tidally inundated forests. Additionally, for forests with aboveground root structures (i.e., mangroves), scattering of the signal by aboveground roots may reduce the signal and reduce ability to identify inundated forests. 6.3.2 Walsh, 1998 “An overview of scale, pattern, process and relationships in geomorphology: A remote sensing and GIS perspective” (Walsh, Butler, and Malanson 1998) 6.3.3 Imhoff, 1990 “The derivation of a sub-canopy digital terrain model of a flooded forest using synthetic aperture radar” (Imhoff and Gesch 1990) Key significance: This is one of the earliest uses of SAR imagery to map digital terrain models and understand tidal inundation in a mangrove forest. The study couples both SAR imagery as well as field measurements of tidal inundation in a novel manner, and provides discussion of syncing the timing of imagery acquisition with hydrological records. Key notes: The study employed data from both the SIR-B mission as well as tide surface information to create a digital terrain model in southern Bangladesh. They note the importance of hydrology and geomorphology on mangrove health, citing Lugo and Snedaker’s discussion in which they note that “tidal dynamics” and “water chemistry” are the two most important factors on mangrove health. The radar data used for the study consisted of three HH polarized L-band radar images, acquired at 26, 46 and 58 degree angles of incidence. The field data comprised of tide gauge data from give stations throughout the region slightly larger than the survey area, a 1200 m topographic survey transect, and test plots in the forest that were visited during the radar data acquisition period. DN counterparts to mean backscatter coefficients were used to select break points fro classifying flooded versus non-flooded forests. Results All three datasets were coregistered, and field data were used to train a model on flooded vs. non-flooded forest areas. A spatial filter by a 5 by 5 and then 11 by 11 median filter to remove speckling. The processed image allowed for better discriminating between classes at a spatial frequency appropriate to the formation. The 58 and 46 deg images were combined to produce an inundation map (the 26 deg data had issues during time of collection, but was used for validation of land edge boundaries), and subsequently into a topographic map. In doing so they produced numbers along the inundation boundaries, which took on values of elevation level relative to mean sea level. The values of the pixels were used as points and an interpolation procedure was used to produce a continuous DTM. The authors then discuss various sources of error, which include resolution issues, measurement error, as well as imprecise measures of “flooded” vs “non-flooded” forest recognition by the L-band SAR imagery. 6.3.4 Souza-Filho &amp; Paradella, 2002 “Recognition of the main geobotanical features along the Bragan{}a mangrove coast (Brazilian Amazon Region) from Landsat TM and RADARSAT-1 data” (Pedro Walfir Martins Souza-Filho and Paradella 2002) Key contribution: This study exemplifies integration of Landsat and SAR data for mapping of different ecosystem types and successional classes along the Bragan{}a coastline at a landscape scale. Incorporation of landsat and SAR data enables mapping of not only different ecosystem types, but also successional classes (e.g., young vs. mature intertidal mangroves, degraded and renegerated mangroves, etc.). Key notes: The authors process Landsat TM and RADARSAT-1 SAR data, and built a composite product using a “Intensity, Hue and Saturation” transform. The transform uses a RGB/IHS transform that incorporates channels formed from PCA of Landsat bands 1, 3 &amp; 3; bands 5 &amp; 7; band 4; as well as a intensity band from the RADARSAT-1 data (described in Harris et al., 1994, Paradella et al, 1998, Pohl, 1998). The resulting map incorporates the spectral data as well as the intensity data corresponding to SAR topography, with an array of colors and values across the landscape. Using field data and prior knowledge, the authors then visually interpret the map into a variety of different land features. Key criticism - they do not provide a full accuracy assessment and thus it is unclear how accurate their results are. The map provides much more information (colors) than is interpreted, and thus it is unclear how legible the map necessarily is (classifications may be too fine scale). They produce a map with 19 classes of the landscape, but it is unclear how they arrive at this point. Assuming that they used the integrated product and supervised classification. Nevertheless, if we take the procedure for granted, they are able to distinguish between a variety of geobotanical features, including: channels, open water, mudflats, coastal dunes, young intertidal mangroves, intertidal mangroves, supratidal mangroves, degraded mangroves, outer salt marshes, and urban areas. The final map classification as they provide it is shown below: Conclusion The methods are a little black-boxey and may require digging into the associated PhD thesis (in Portuguese), but the map is an interesting approach to pulling information from both spectral (Landsat TM) as well as radar-based (RADARSAT-1) information. 6.3.5 Souza-Filho, 2003 “Use of synthetic aperture radar for recognition of coastal geomorphological features, land-use assessment and shoreline changes in Bragan{}a coast, Para, Northern Brazil” (P W M Souza-Filho and Paradella 2003) Key contribution: This study is a sister study to that of (Pedro Walfir Martins Souza-Filho and Paradella 2002), and examines mapping of geomorphology as well as changes in coastal extents over time. The study uses SAR data acquired from over a 30 year period to investigate areas of coastal progradation versus erosion. Key notes: The difference in SAR return from land versus water is largely a function of contrast of dielectric properties as well as surface roughness, and allows for striking interface along coastal landscapes. The two SAR imagery datasets used were airborne X-HH band data from 1972, and orbital (satellite-based) C-HH band data from 1998. Both images were acquired at high tide conditions. Imagery were ortho-rectified based on ground points that were obtained during a field campaign. The SAR imagery from 1972 was used to distinguish between terrain and open water, converted to a vector dataset, and overlaid on the 1998 imagery to examine changes in shoreline over time. The authors provide a nice overview of the steps that must be taken for use of SAR data (i.e., processing): Input data Reading of image orbit data and 16 bit RADARSAT data Proprocessing phase Radiometric correction - scaling of 16 bits to 8 bits, ground control point selection Geometric correction - math model for geometric correction, geometric ortho-correction + speckle reduction Enhancement Linear stretch Assessment of SAR product Radargeologic interpretation Results - Mapping of land cover classes The authors used visual interpretation to identify six prominent geomorphological coastal features. Intertidal vs. supratidal mangroves can be determined given different microwave responses to vegetation. Supratidal mangroves are shorter and more open, and thus result in a reduced double-bounce effect relative to intertidal mangroves. They used aerial imagery in conjunction with the SAR data to help validate some of their land classifications. Results - Mapping of shoreline change Other studies have noted that mapping shoreline change during Spring High Tide Level is most appropriate, thus both images were acquired at same high tide condition. The authors conclude that the shorelines has been subject to severe erosion, but I’m also not sure how they distinguish between this and sea level rise during the time period. They identify both areas of erosion as well as deposition, but with a net effect of erosion in the study region. They note that deposition of sand has killed mangrove vegetation, and thus the mangrove terrace has largely been eroded. They also note that in other areas, sediment supply and protection from wave attacks has allowed for accretion of sandbanks, muddy deposition and establishment of mangroves. The full map or erosion and accretion in the area is shown below: The authors use the maps of erosion and accretion coupled with ecosystems to understand processes that may be occuring within the landscape. The authors also note, however, that much of the findings are speculations given the absence of wind, wave, and tidal currents data within the region. Time series analysis of SAR data thus may be informative in investigating long-term trends along coastlines, particular for identifying regions of erosion or deposition. 6.3.6 Knight, 2009 “Exploring LiDAR data for mapping the micro-topography and tidal hydro-dynamics of mangrove systems: An example from southeast Queensland, Australia” (Knight et al. 2009) Key contribution: This is one of the very few studies that employs airborner LiDAR to derive a high resolution digital elevation model an examine inundation and hydrology characteristics within a mangrove forest. Key notes: The study was motivated by the need to map habitats for a disease vector mosquito. The digital terrain model that they obtained had a vertical accuracy of 0.5 m, and was validated by using hydrological modeling and field data of tidal gauages over ten days. The accuracy of the DTM and that of field data indicating habitats for mosquitos were found to validate one another. Of key geomorphological importance is the fact that they were able to identify a ridge that ran through the majority of the site as well as back basins and fringing mangroves. The back basin was blocked from tidal waters during all times except for the highest tides. Such understandings may be important for understanding the spatial ecology of a site. The authors also note the importance of the LiDAR derived DTM for understanding effects of SLR on the mangrove forest. Study design LiDAR was flown over the area, producing a shapefile with 3 million points. The points were classified as ground versus non-ground by removal of points not contribution to ground terrain points by +/- 0.1 m. The ground point data was validated against GPS base-station data. 150 points were used to assess vertical accuracy across the entire area. The tidal inundation data was collected from 10 points in the field, recording water depth, pressure and temperature every 5 minutes continuously for 10 days. Locations of the tidal gauges were informed by the DEM, selecting for areas near to tidal source, in depressions or on hummocks. The tidal depths were used to validate inundation patterns expected given the LiDAR DTM. Tidal inundation was modeled in ArcMap by “flooding” of the landscape in 0.05 m increments, with flooding constrained to adjacent to water bodies (i.e., the back basin was not flooded until the berm was breached). Results The use of the DTM was able to identify the presence of a berm as well as back basin. The below figure displays the findings. The top figure displays the elevation along a transect that was conducted along the center of the berm. A minimum elevation can be seen that must be breached for flooding of the back basin. The total DTM for the site can be seen below: The authors conclude that use of LiDAR data for derivation of the DTM was successful, and that the approach that they took may work well for modeling of shifts in hydrology that may occur with sea level rise. 6.3.7 Smith, 2009 “Applications of remote sensing in geomorphology” (Smith and Pain 2009) Key contribution: A review of the use of remote sensing for geomorphology, without a particular focus on mangroves. The article reviews the current platforms and data types, and maps them to their relevant uses within geomorphology. Of particular note: Remote sensing particularly well placed to aid studies of geomorphology in: location and distribution of landforms land surface elevation land surface composition subsurface characterization The authors remark consistently on the added value of digital elevation models (both as products, as well as automatic classification by sensors) for geomorphology. Among most important techniques for postprocessing of LiDAR point clouds for geomorphologists is removing “surface clutter” to extract actual ground surface.

The study uses spatial layers of both suspended sediment as well as tidal range to primarily classify the settings, and emerges with three different classes: Minerogenic and high tidal range (allochthonous) Minerogenic and low tidal range (allochthonous) Organogenic and low tidal range (authochthonous) Key notes: Primarily three different datasets (soil organic matter, total suspended matter, and tidal range) were used for the classifications of different geomorphic settings. Study design The first dataset is that of soil organic matter, and was compiled from the academic literature. The second dataset is total suspended matter, which was derived from the MERIS spectrometer (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) aboard the European Envisat satellite. The data employed was a product of TSM available from ESA’s Global Ocean Colour for Carbon Cycle Research Project. Tidal range data used was a layer built from the FES2012 (Finite Element Solution-Global tide) model, which is one of the more accurate models for shallow continental shelf locations. For each SOM value, a 50 km radius was used to average TSM and tidal data to characterize the site. K-means clustering was used to separate the data into three different groups and thus define borders between sites of different character. Results TSM values were highest near outlets of major rivers. Multiple linear regression showed that SOM was negatively associated with increasing tidal range and total suspended matter. The k-means clustering and classification of sites from which they had data are shown below: Key findings Their results show that sites with SOM &gt; 60% were found mostly in the Caribbean, Hawaii and Florida. Sites elsewhere had average OM values of ~10%, and thus broad description of mangrove soils as “peat” is misleading. The broad majority of mangrove soils globally are organogenic. They then describe a variety of relevant mangrove restoration and management techniques relevant for the various mangrove geomorphic settings. In organogenic settings, key risk is collapse of peat following disturbance. Influences on root productivity such as nutrient availability as well as inundation levels are of key importance. They note that low tidal ranges often indicate the importance of seasonal flooding to the site. Management and restoration in microtidal sites is thus often concerned with preserving networks of terrestrial freshwater sources. Minerogenic sites require high levels of sediment input to maintain intertidal surfaces at correct elevation relative to tidal frame, and thus proper management of hydroperiod at rates which mangrove prefer. Disturbances in sediment supply may influence long term health of mangroves. Use of bamboo fences in Vietnam and Thailand may help to reduce tidal energy and wave energy and promote sediment deposition. Interesting that they note the Chao Phraya river has undergone a ~75% reduction in sediment yield, with severe coastal erosion resulting. Placeholder "],

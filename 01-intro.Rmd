# Introduction

This book is a documentation of the key concepts, findings, and figures of the assigned literature for my qualifying exam. In organizing the literature review in a book, the various concepts are able to be synthesized, interlinked, and mapped to my own research ideas and efforts.

## Research summary

My research interests are broadly focused on parsing apart the relative influence of autochthonous (within the system) vs. allochthonous (from outside of the system) inputs to organic carbon in mangrove sediments. I aim to investigate whether remote sensing and ecoinformatics (standardization and aggregation of disperse field data) can be leveraged to better understand heterogeneity both within and across sites.

## Fields of examination

The topics covered in the exam are namely:

1. Mangrove forest ecology, with an emphasis on regeneration dynamics (Wayne)
2. Mangrove soil organic carbon and geomorphology (Ron)
3. Remote sensing of wetlands, with a particular focus on mangroves (Iryna)
4. Ecoinformatics, tipping points, and decision-making theory (Carl)

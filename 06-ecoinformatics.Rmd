*"Defining and unraveling biocomplexity"* [@michener2001defining]

**Key contribution:** This study's primary contribution to the literature is a formal definition of biocomplexity, and an investigation of its emergence within the scientific disciplines. The article primarily discusses:

  1. Defining biocomplexity
  2. Examining the characteristics of biocomplexity
  3. Speculating on future of biocomplexity
  
*Biocomplexity* - "properties emerging from the interplay of behavioral, biological, chemical, physical, and social interactions that affect, sustain, or are modified by living organisms, including humans" (as defined by [@michener2001defining])
  
**Key notes: **

  - Biocomplexity exists in contrast to the Popperian type of reductionalist science (causality & falsification), and recognizes that reduced causal mechanisms often are not robust within real-world situations
    - "myriad confounding factors operating at different temporal and spatial scales"
  - Two features of "biocomplexity"
    1. biocomplexity occurs as temporal, spatial and conceptual boundaries are broken-down and worked across
    2. emergent & unexpected properties may (or likely will) arise in response to biocomplexity

**Characteristics of "biocomplexity":**

  1. relevant for a wide range of organisms microbial to megafauna [(including humans)]
  2. relevant for a wide range of environments
  3. reflected in nonlinear, chaotic, or unpredictable behaviors -- which likely necessitates sophisticated and innovative quantitative procedures
  4. likely to span many hierarchical levels as well as across multiples scales in space and time
    
**Key research trajectories for ecology (as posed by Thompson 2001):**

  1. "dynamics of coalescence in complex communities" - how do environmental constraints and species availability result in current complex ecological communities
  2. "ecological memory" - how do past events & conditions influence current ecological structure conditions
  3. "emergent properties" - examining whether first principles of "hard" sciences can predict composition, structure & function
  4. "ecological topology" - identifying "rules" that occur over different scales of time and space and examining how they interact to produce ecosystems

### Jones *et al*, 2006

*"The new bioinformatics: Integrating ecological data from the gene to the biosphere"* [@jones2006new]

**Key contribution:** This paper makes the case for "locating, accessing and integrating" data within ecology. They provide examples of the successes associated with doing so in alternative fields (genetics), and make a case for the need within ecology. They also outline metadata-drive versus vertically integrated databases (data warehouses), and the relative pros/cons of the two.

**Examples of metadata and data collections in ecology:**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/jones2006AREES.bmp"))
```

**Key notes**: Some relevant points from the article:

  - Focus on "experimental" design and testing of multiple hypotheses makes ecological data inherently heterogeneous.
  - Ecoinformatics importance is housed in ability to "allow a broader perspective over time and space, and across many disciplines, than is possible from on or a few studies," and in allowing data to be reused for questions that may emerge in the future.
  - Current standard for storing of data is in heterogeneous spreadsheets
  - *Data warehouses (vertically-integrated)* - databases that coalesce data from many investigators, but focused on one theme and searchable often through an online interface; often represents a "least-common denominator" approach in that they are less complex than original dataset
    - examples: GenBank, VegBank or TreeBase
  - *Data collections (metadata-drive)* - collection of datasets that are loosely structured together by well-crafted metadata
    - advantages:
      1. data of disparate types can be housed within a single location
      2. focuses on project-level data and thus is familiar to researchers
      3. metadata often more detailed
      4. metadata often more precise and thus can be used in search functions
  - *metadata standards* - "consistent and rigorous sets of definitions for metadata categories that are broadly adopted by a research community"
    - Several examples exist within ecology:
      1. Ecological Metadata Language (EML)
      2. Biological Data Profile (BDP)
      3. Geographic Markup Language (GML)
    - the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) is a metadata-drive repo that provides mappings from EML to BDP (but not from BDP to EML as of time of article publication).
  - *data islands* - data derived from researchers working on disparate, autonomous topics that focus on specific, predetermined hypotheses
    - often subject to entrenched domain-specific vocabularies and also assumptions
  - *ontologies* - well-defined concepts or terms that have precise meanings within a specific domain or field, as well as how the terms interrelate
    - *Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge (SEEK)* - one example of a system developing ontologies within ecology

### Michener, 2006

*"Meta-information concepts for ecological data management"* [@michener2006meta]

**Definitions:**
  - *metadata* - "information about data"; higher level descriptions of data
  - *meta-information* - information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses

**Key contribution:** Michener outlines some of the key criteria, challenges and opportunities for metadata within an ecological context.

**Notes on metadata: **

  - Benefits of metadata
    1. Longevity of the data is greatly increased
    2. Reuse of the data both by the original researcher and others is facilitated
    3. Well-documented data may be used to expand scale of ecological inquiry
  - Metadata functionality
    1. Supports data discovery (most basic level)
    2. Facilitates the acquisition and use of data by humans (requires additional metadata)
    3. Enables automatic discovery, ingestion and analysis of data (requires more sophisticated metadata), which needs:
      a. research context (hypothesis, study site, experimental design, etc.)
      b. status of dataset
      c. physical structure of dataset
      d. info to facilitate use and comprehension
      
**Ecological Metadata Language (EML):**

  - EML is a standard for metadata that provides structure that supports automated functions of metadata listed above and is implemented in eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
  - Organized into modules, such as "dataset", "access", "physical", "party coverage", "project", "methods", "datatable", "attribute", and "physical"

### Bekker *et al*, 2007

*"Long term datasets: From descriptive to prescriptive data using ecoinformatics"* [@bekker2007long]

**Key contribution:** This is the lead article to a special issue in *Journal of Vegetation Science* that focuses on ecoinformatics driven approaches to understanding complexity within vegetation systems. The article is less informative in its own right as much as a good pointer to other key studies working with vegetation science and ecoinformatics. It appears to be one of the earliest applications of ecoinformatics to vegetation science.

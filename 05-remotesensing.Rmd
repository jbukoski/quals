# Remote sensing

## Overview

### Smith, 2009

*"Applications of remote sensing in geomorphology"* [@smith2009applications]

**Key contribution:** A review of the use of remote sensing for geomorphology, without a particular focus on mangroves. The article reviews the current platforms and data types, and maps them to their relevant uses within geomorphology.

**Of particular note:**

Remote sensing particularly well placed to aid studies of geomorphology in:

  1. location and distribution of landforms
  2. land surface elevation
  3. land surface composition
  4. subsurface characterization

```

The authors remark consistently on the added value of digital elevation models (both as products, as well as automatic classification by sensors) for geomorphology.

Among most important techniques for postprocessing of LiDAR point clouds for geomorphologists is removing "surface clutter" to extract actual ground surface.

### Adam, 2010

*"Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing for identification and mapping of wetland vegetation: A review"* [@adam2010multispectral]

**Key contribution: ** This review examines the status quo of mapping wetland vegetation using spectral (multi and hyper) imagery, with a particular focus on discriminating wetland vegetation as well as monitoring biophysical and biochemical characteristics.

**Key findings: ** 

  - the spectral and spatial composition of mangrove species and vegetation assemblages has complicated use of multispectral (broadband) imagery; hyperspectral (narrowband) imagery is promising but more difficult to access
    - spectral signatures of different wetland veg are often similar, and are "muddied" by spectral reflectance from soil, hydrologic regime or atmospheric conditions
  - spectral signatures affected most strongly by biochemical and biophysical properties of leaves, which vary greatly across species
  - discrimination of wetland species from Landsat TM or SPOT imagery has generally been insufficient due to:
    1. lack of fine, ecological divisions between vegetation species
    2. broad nature of spectral wavebands
    3. lack of high spectral and spatial resolution to detect subcanopy vegetation types
  - ANNs and fuzzy classification techniques have shown promise in better classifying mixed species pixels
  - most important biochemical and biophysical properties characterizing wetland species are:
    1. chlorophyll - green pigment
    2. biomass concentration - biophysical prop
    3. leaf water content
  - major issue of using vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) to estimate biomass is the saturation problem
    - Mutanga and Skidmore (2004) propose one mechanism to resolve saturation problem
  - building spectral libraries via hyperspectral sensors is critical for discriminating wetland species, but also needs investigation at different sites & scales as reflectance within species may vary depending on environmental conditions
  
**Research ideas:**

  1. Spectral imagery can be effective in monitoring plant water content, which may vary significantly across mangrove species due to differing water use efficiencies

### Heumann, 2011

*"Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities"* [@heumann2011satellite]

**Key contribution: ** One of several reviews of mangroves and remote sensing techniques that focuses primarily (i.e., solely) on vegetation mapping. 

**Key findings: **
  
  - Spectral discrimination of different species not successful using multispectral (broadband) imagery (Ramsey and Jensen, 1996).
    - Mixed pixels also an issue for discriminating species as well as estimating canopy structure
  - Spectral saturation at high biomass values is a particular problem for mapping biomass and volumes
  - Very high resolution imagery effective at reducing mixed pixels just due to smaller size
  - OBIA has typically been applied to species discrimination rather than extent of mangrove mappings
  - Quickbird and IKONOS sensors are most common for very high resolution imagery due to long-term archiving of data
    - multispectral sensors but show improvement over Landsat TM or ETM+ due to reduced numbers of mixed pixels
  - Use of spectral data only is often insufficient for discrimination of species
    - Classification accuracies are greatly improved when other image properties are considered, such as texture
    - Texture analaysis has been applied to species discrimination, but has not been investigated (as of 2011) for other forest characteristics
  - C-band PolSAR has lowest ability to parse forest structure of SAR bands
  
*Mangrove biomass specific findings:*

  - Canopy height and biomass have been shown to be strongly correlated in mangroves (e.g., Fromard et al., 1998; Smith and Whelan, 2006)
    - must studies of height and biomass have employed SAR data
    - different polarizations (based on wavelength) interact differently with different components of the forest
      - trunks and soils may produce single or double bounce interactions
      - signal may scatter within canopy
        - P-band POLSAR or HV polarization of L-band SAR perform best in mapping aboveground biomass

*Very-high resolution satellites:*

  - The IKONOS and Quickbird are most commonly used, due to archiving of data and plans for long-term consistency
    1. IKONOS > GeoEye-1 (successor) (multispect @ 1.65 m and panchrom @ 0.41 m)
    2. Quickbird > Worldview-2 (successor) (<2m multi, <0.5 m panchrom)
      - note that Worldview-2 has 8 multispectral channels, including those in yellow and red edge ranges designed for veg studies

**Research ideas:**

  - Coupling of species mapping with species-specific allometry equations for better estimates of mangrove biomass
    - Might make sense in Americas where just three species exist (easier!)

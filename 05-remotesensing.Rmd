# Remote sensing

## Overview

### Smith, 2009

*"Applications of remote sensing in geomorphology"* [@smith2009applications]

**Key contribution:** A review of the use of remote sensing for geomorphology, without a particular focus on mangroves. The article reviews the current platforms and data types, and maps them to their relevant uses within geomorphology.

**Of particular note:**

Remote sensing particularly well placed to aid studies of geomorphology in:

  1. location and distribution of landforms
  2. land surface elevation
  3. land surface composition
  4. subsurface characterization

```

The authors remark consistently on the added value of digital elevation models (both as products, as well as automatic classification by sensors) for geomorphology.

Among most important techniques for postprocessing of LiDAR point clouds for geomorphologists is removing "surface clutter" to extract actual ground surface.
